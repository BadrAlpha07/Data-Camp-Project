Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Send us YOUR 2020 wedding/proposal videos ❤️💍 and you’ll be part of our official video for our wedding song, “Step Into A Love Like This” written and sung by @laurenhashianofficial. We are completely BLOWN AWAY by all of your amazing and beautiful responses to our song and wedding anniversary 🙏🏾🙏🏾 and we wanted to now share it with you in a more meaningful way.
We figured if we were going to make an “official video” for the song to be released - then let us all share our wedding memories and mana together.
2020 weddings have certainly been a challenge with Covid, but it didn’t stop any of us from “stepping into a love” like this. Send us your wedding videos to LaurenHashian.Com and we can’t wait to make some magic and create an unforgettable video ❤️🥃🎥

I dive into more detail on the “why” and the character’s mythology as well as a few key filmmakers who are ready to bring Black Adam’s story to life as we begin shooting this summer.
How do I find balance in my wildly busy life?
Easily one of my most asked questions, since finding our balance & wellness is something we all continue to strive for daily in our busy lives.
My family.
My gym.
My pick up truck

Kourtney Kardashian,TV Star,4045,140,"As a mother, there is a natural instinct to protect my children from anything that might make them feel sad or unsafe. The pain and suffering inflicted by racism is not a thing of the past and I bare the responsibility to speak with my kids honestly and often about it, even when the truth is uncomfortable. I have to make sure they understand what it means to have white privilege and to take the time to learn and discuss Black History, beyond just one short month out of the year.

I encourage other mothers to join me in using this as a learning lesson for our children, to allow our children to feel comfortable enough to come talk to us about anything. Allow conversation without judgement, and learn from our children too. We don’t know it all. My children sometimes ask questions that I may not know the answers to, so we explore them together. I’ve felt like I’ve always been on the right side of this, but I have a lot to learn and want to educate myself even more, so that I can be a better mother, a better auntie to my nieces and nephews, a better friend, and a better person.

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"From Greta ❤️: “I am brimming with happiness—thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you (that’s six!) to the Academy. This film of Little Women has been over thirty years in the making, from the very first time Louisa May Alcott and Jo March reached across time and space and made me believe I could be a writer and creator. Every single person who worked on this film poured their heart and soul into it, and we are all so grateful to the Academy for recognizing the collective effort. I am so personally proud of each person who worked on the film, and I am bursting with joy for all of them. I have to say a few names loudly, because I am just so deeply thrilled for them—my filming partner/wizard/genius Saoirse Ronan, you are my inspiration and my honesty and my co-captain, always, my baby girl superstar Florence Pugh, the Marmee of our dreams Laura Dern (woot! Marriage Story!!), our gorgeously talented and ridiculously intelligent Emma Watson, the bright shining soul and life force Eliza Scanlen, our Queen Meryl, and the fifth March sister and all around prince Timothee Chalamet. The men who, as Louisa says, make “chivalry worth having,” Chris Cooper, Tracy Letts, James Norton, Bob Odenkirk, and Louis Garrel The costumes of Jacqueline Durran, the sets of Jess Gonchor, and the music of Alexandre Desplat—they gave me such incredible gifts and each frame of the movie is filled with their skill and work and care. Amy Pascal, I have no words big enough but you know what is in my heart. Everyone at Sony and Columbia Pictures, especially to Tom Rothman, my favorite sparring partner and tireless champion. Writing and directing this film was an honor and sharing it with audiences has been the most sincerely heart-warming journey. I hope our Little Women does for another generation of girls and women what it did for me: lights a fire to write your book, make your movie, sing your verse. From all of us Little Women and Men, thank you to the Academy.”",4031,2235860,2020-01-14 23:47:10+00:00,Photo,2020,1,14,23,Tuesday,2020-01-14,55864658,356,4.009495592007383

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"Steve has been my mentor and friend since we made his first book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, into a film together. He gave me the great honour of being 'Sam' - one of the coolest girls ever captured on celluloid – and also one of the best summers of my life as well as my favourite movie-making experience ever.
Since then, wherever we are in the world, in a good year I'll hope to see Steve four or five times. We mostly get food. At dinners with Steve I always end up asking the waiter for a pen, or being sat in the dark furiously scratching away at my phone trying not to miss… What exactly was it he said? How precisely did he phrase it?!!! When I called him after reading this [new] book one of the first things I said was that I was so relieved I didn’t have to spend our dinners together decimating table spreads, napkins, the backs of receipts and hoping my phone doesn't die anymore. Because this book contains so many of the ideas I have wanted to make sure I never forgot... And hoped that the world might get to know.

Like The Perks of Being a Wallflower, the book says that no matter how dark the places you have been or the things you have seen, there's an undeniable road map. No-one and nothing and no-where is beyond redemption... Except maybe ""the nice man"" but we will have to wait for the second book to know the truth... What is hilarious and laugh out loud genius is that he seems to have disguised all this wisdom in an entertaining zombie thriller movie... In true Steve Chbosky style he gives you the bran and the donut. Spiritual enlightenment AND Spielberg-esque horror movie thriller. I don't know how he did it. But he did it. It's a masterpiece. The profundity of Milton that's actually page-turning. I'm so proud of my friend.

This role is a special one and HIGHLY entertaining.

Playing my grandma, Lia Maivia will be the one of a kind, Ana Tuisila.

Cool backstory: My grandmother, Lia Maivia was pro wrestling’s first women’s promoter. She HAD TO BE tough as nails in a male dominated, shark infested world of wrestling.
She set the bar for tough business practices and also set the bar for how loving a sweet grandma could be to her only grandson - me ☺️

She was also charged by the feds for extortion, eventually deported, became homeless and lost everything in the early 90’s.

Crazy life.

I was blessed enough to help change that hard time scenario around and get her back on her feet.

Her journey was unreal and can’t wait for you guys to watch!

Reading and writing have always played an important role in my life...they directly link me to being a creative person, and that’s why partnering with @PilotPenUSA made sense. Through their annual G2 Overachievers Grant and G2 Overachievers Student Grant, Pilot gives out over $100,000 to exceptional individuals who go above and beyond their everyday lives and responsibilities to give back to their communities, and improve the lives of others. I’m honored to be helping select the recipients for 2019, so whether it’s you or someone you know, send me your hand written submission by visiting G2Overachievers.com for full details 💙

In this shot you see only a handful of our 300+ crew members - due to strict COVID policies we have multiple zones to ensure there’s as little intersection as possible.

This crew is my family and many I’ve worked with for 10+ years and counting - their resolve and commitment to delivering a great product for our global audience never ceases to inspire and motivate me daily.

Especially in these challenging conditions 😷

Always my pleasure to punch the clock and put in the hard work with these human beings.

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"Why I Choose @ObagiMedical | #SKINCLUSION #ObagiPartner

Over the past few months, I’ve been using the @obagimedical Vitamin C skin care line and it’s made a world of difference… the products have the purest form of Vitamin C and my skin looks and feels so good.

I love working with this team because we share the same values. I choose Obagi not only because they have such great products but also because they are the first professional skin care brand to conduct research on all skin tones, including mine and yours! They understand and appreciate that our beauty lies in our differences. For regular updates on #SKINCLUSION and also a chance to win my awesome Obagi #SkinCareRegimen, follow @obagimedical and @obagiclinical. A special thank you to everyone who has used #SKINCLUSION to support diversity and inclusion. Please keep those posts coming to spark a donation from @obagimedical to @icdo.at and #ProjectImplicit. It’s up to all of us to be conscious, to be fearless and to be beautiful! #SafeGuardingDiversity #ICDO",2944,5106768,2019-06-24 17:38:54+00:00,Video,2019,6,24,17,Monday,2019-06-24,45121658,172,11.324300184182064

Kourtney Kardashian,TV Star,4045,140,"I call myself @badassboz, but my father named me Bozoma— after his mother. My name can be loosely translated to mean Spirit or Goddess; originating from the Nzema and Fanti people of Ghana, and I’m proudly 1st generation American. Although I have many titles and descriptions, being BLACK is an identity that I hold with reverence. My melanin skin which bounces off the sun and soaks in its rays fills me with joy... and sometimes can hurt with pain of carrying the weight of injustice that I face. I’ve walked through America’s largest corporate hallways and had a C-suite seat in its boardrooms, but although I sashay in my stilettos, I recognize that we are not all seen as equal. As we’ve seen the murders of Black people because of racism and police brutality, like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd, there are many other horrendous unseen acts committed every day. We must all be vigilant to ensure that the bias which goes unchecked, doesn’t become a static that we then hashtag. We must work together to HEAR those who cry out for the basic, human right to breathe and to matter.⁣⁣

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"🥰💪🏻🌹 #Repost @gloriasteinem “3rd edition out today with a new foreword by my dear @emmawatson. I had a lot of fun updating it, hope you’ll feel the same reading it!”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
📚❤️ “Why do I love Gloria’s writing so much? She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading, into something not only relatable but enjoyable...She believes in personal testimony - the sharing and passing on of women’s stories...She uncovers things that are obscured by today’s conditioning and normalizing which when exposed, are absolutely fascinating...Her plain common sense - calling things out as they are - will make you laugh out loud...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Sometimes the world she envisions seems so far out and impossible to me or just wildly optimistic. But I have come to believe it is through radical feminism and the radical nature of Gloria’s message, that the job of equality will get done. I used to think the citadel didn’t have to topple. Now I believe it just might and should, and that we need to let old ways of being die for something new to be born. This book contains ideas for that new road, even though some were written almost forty years ago.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People have asked me what the feminist movement needs to succeed. A new word? More men involved? I would rephrase the question. What obstacles need to be removed for us to succeed? In order to win our full humanity, in life, we have to confront the biggest superpower in the world: the patriarchy...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I never liked the idea of being a rebel. I played Hermione Granger, for goodness sake, who once famously compared the notion of being expelled to death! I remember thinking my first detention was the end of the world. But of all the things to fight for, I’d say freedom and respect are pretty good ones! And if I can do it with, and in the wake of, women like Gloria, all the better. And actually, as Hermione and I learned, being disruptive was quite fun after all.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So, have your mind blown, laugh out loud, think in new ways, get angry, feel the feminist affinity...This was the first collection of feminist writing Gloria ever published...I hope they become as precious to you.” 🧡📖",2372,746069,2019-02-12 23:49:35+00:00,Photo,2019,2,12,23,Tuesday,2019-02-12,52850314,380,1.4161524186970773

Kim Kardashian,TV Star,5373,117,"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is. For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn’t where we would be eating. I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home. All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It’s where each Kardashian child was born and made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper and kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings, decor out of the same fabric and print as the wallpaper. We had lunch at the home as if it hadn’t changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned. I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked. I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks! This was the most special, nostalgic day of my life and we felt my dad’s presence enjoying this day with us!
I kept it together and didn’t cry the entire lunch even though I cried during the entire planning process. But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door and cried so hard.",33549,4177691,2019-11-06 00:56:35+00:00,Photo,2019,11,6,0,Wednesday,2019-11-06,150840492,337,2.7918498170902284

A sad Christmas song I wrote a few years back right before the holidays. Was feeling like shit cause I couldn’t be with the one I loved. Even with a house full of family and friends I still felt alone . In ways that still feels relevant and someone reading this right now could possibly relate! If you feel lonely this season just know YOU ARE COMPLETELY MADE OF MAGIC! You are as special as a snowflake , beautifully unique and I hope inside your soul feels light, hope , peace , and joy knowing how singularly amazing YOU are! Love always wins! 🎄 PS @waynecoyne5 & @stevendrozd are so bad ass for helping me put this together so fuckin fast so I could share w my fans by Christmas!

Presenting the trailer of #TheSkyIsPink - a film about love, made with so much of it. On a personal note, it’s a very proud milestone moment for me, because it’s my first as an actor & co-producer AND this is the first Hindi production for @purplepebblepictures.

As I watched with my family, the same as so many of you in the US, India, throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond, it gave me so much hope that inspite of all the hardship maybe we’ll all emerge from this kinder and more compassionate. ⁣

Demi Lovato,Musician,317,691,"I recently visited @farmsanctuary, which is the first animal rescue specifically for farm animals in the U.S. I spent the day with cows, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys, and turkeys, who were all rescued from cruelty. The highlight of my tour was cuddling with a rescued turkey named Sandy. Not only are these animals cute, but they are forgiving. The animals at @farmsanctuary had to learn to trust humans after what they’d been through, and their strength and resilience is amazing! 💖🦃🐮🐑 Check out adoptaturkey.org or @farmsanctuary’s page for more information! #AdoptATurkey

I will keep your spirit here by continuing to do good for others and treating them the way we all desire to be treated. With an infinite amount of the same gentle kindness you displayed daily. We will ache everyday you are not with us....",8597,994228,2020-08-22 15:57:35+00:00,Photo,2020,8,22,15,Saturday,2020-08-22,113985584,129,0.8797823065064088

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"🌻✨✌🏻 So honoured to be working alongside Nobel Peace Laureates @nadia_murad_taha, @drdenismukwege @ouidedbouchamaoui, and other 🧠 thought leaders, 🌈 creatives and 🌱💪🏻 campaigners such as @AranyaJohar Assia Benziane @missaissa as part of the Gender Equality Council advising the G7 this year during the French Presidency. 💐 It's a source of sadness to us all that Nasrin Sotoudeh can only participate in absentia. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻💞 Together we’ll be continuing the work of the first Council convened last year in Canada and will be pushing G7 states and others to do more to make gender equality a reality at home and abroad. ⏰ At a time when many might feel a loss of confidence in politicians and the state, it's easy to forget how vital 🗳 national governments and👩🏼‍⚖️ legislation are in the ⚙️ wheel of factors that create meaningful and lasting change.♟📰 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
❤️🚨 Disengaging is quite simply not an option when in many parts of the world, we're seeing roll-backs 🕰🔙 on women and girls' rights and 🚫💰 cutbacks and corrosions to the basic state services that guarantee these rights. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🙋🏼‍♀️ As a Council, we’ll be recommending ways that states can improve their laws 🔎📜✍🏻 to strengthen women’s rights and will be encouraging them to make new commitments to ensure accountability and access to justice. 🗣⚖️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🏃🏼‍♀️💨 The clock is ticking though and we have a lot of work to do before the G7 meets in the summer, ⏳☀️ but I'm excited to work alongside so many experts I admire, and to learn from my Council colleagues and the civil society groups that come together as W7. ✊🏻💛
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As one of the youngest members of the group, 🍃🌸 I hope to bring the perspective of different generations to the table, as well as ensuring that the voices of the many activists, campaigners, women's organisations and movements that I've spent the past years working with and👂🏻💓 listening to, reverberate through the Council's work. 🎶🌼

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"The mate to my soul ❤️💍

One year ago today, on August 18, 2019 - I had the honor of marrying @laurenhashianofficial.
Later that night she surprised me with this beautiful song, “Step Into A Love Like This” that she wrote and sang herself in honor of our marriage.

From the moment I heard the song’s opening line, of “...every angel in heaven is singing for us today...” as tribute to our loved ones who’ve passed away and no longer with us - I got very emotional.
As I still get emotional today when I hear those words and watch this wedding footage.

Lauren is a gifted and soulful songwriter who wrote every single word of this song (and her vows) to reflect our life and blessings on our wedding day.

I’m not a writer, so all I can do is speak from my heart and gut — and other than my three daughters being born — this is the greatest gift I’ve ever received.
Bottom line, I’m a lucky and grateful husband, father and man to have such an amazing woman by my side through this unpredictable, yet beautiful thing we call life.

Special shout to my extremely loving daughters, Jazzy and Tia for accompanying daddy as I got down on my knee to do the honors of asking for Lauren’s hand in marriage. Technically, she never said, “YES!” as she just bursted out laughing and then ugly crying, BUT I’ll take that response on the Hawaiian cliffs any day 😉💍

We hope that you all enjoy “Step Into A Love Like This” and our wedding day moments - as much as we are privileged to share it with you all on our anniversary.

With love, gratitude and mana - DJ 🖤

Listen to the song now in my bio or on all music platforms.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Q&A. Great questions 🌎👊🏾 What is my why?

My “why” has continued to evolve over the years — like many of us, I’m sure.
Thru my teens and early 20’s, my “why” was me working my ass off, because I didn’t want to be broke.
I was tired of living that “$7 bucks” life.
Then, my “why” became my passion.
Then my “why” became my babies.
Now, my “why” is my family and working my ass off to build my legacy.
In the end, our legacy is the thing that we all leave behind.
Thank you guys for the amazing questions.
Good to stay connected and positive with ya around the world during these tough times.
Stay healthy. Stay disciplined. We’ll get thru this, together.

At our Teremana Distilleria, in the Jalisco Highlands of Mexico, we pride ourselves on the highest of quality and craftsmanship all done by hand and with great respect.

The traditional way.
The old school way.
The right way.

From using only the most mature blue agave to slow roasting it’s piña at a very low temperature for a longer period of time in our traditional brick ovens.

To using only copper pot stills (FYI, copper pots are used to produced the most expensive, high premium tequilas) giving our Teremana a much more unique, clean taste.

But the most important thing to me, is to make sure that Teremana is always accessible and affordable for EVERYONE.

The true tequila of the people 🥃

I founded Teremana to build a true legacy brand, to be passed on to generations - built on a foundation of the highest of quality and best of taste.

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"Self-education is an essential part of any anti-racist journey, and reading has always been a huge part of my personal learning. In 2016 I started @oursharedshelf, a bookclub to create conversations around intersectionality, feminism and equal rights and to profile feminist writers. Many of the writers and books we featured over the years are relevant to anyone wanting to understand that the struggle for racial justice has been a long one, that ALL Black Lives Matter and women’s voices are a vital part of any movement for change. Alice Walker, Bell Hooks, Maya Angelou, Roxane Gay, Reni Eddo-Lodge, Angie Thomas, Audre Lorde, Brittney Cooper, and Toni Morrison are just some of the authors we featured and which I urge you to check out if you haven’t already.⁣

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Training tip as you guys are getting back into your gyms around the world and making your fitness a priority once again.
When training legs, try ending your workout with a focused, high rep compound movement - squats, leg press or in my case today a vertical leg press.
Remember to keep the weight light and focus on the strict movement.
My strength & conditioning coach @daverienzi and I have found it to be extremely beneficial towards your gains.
Welcome back to your gyms, give this finisher a shot and enjoy the burn 😉💪🏾
Train smart. Train healthy.

🗳 Take control of the Senate away from the Republicans attempting a coup. Your vote matters so much that they are willing to destroy democracy in the pursuit of retaining power. Power that #KellyLoeffler & #DavidPerdue have shown that they will NOT use to help the people of GA or the US, but instead to enrich themselves & their donors, while the American people suffer.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"My closing speech to our incredible RED NOTICE crew. That is a wrap ✔️

I have wrapped many of big productions in my career, but none will ever compare to wrapping RED NOTICE and what this represents.

The gratitude, the emotion (I had a pause during these remarks for a moment) and the galvanized spirit of this crew - whom I consider my family - who locked arms with us and went shoulder to shoulder to sacrifice their time with their families, battle thru extreme COVID conditions, to proudly and tirelessly be the hardest workers in the room who will always
GET THE JOB DONE.

Over 800 crew members.
Over 2000 Covid tests per week.
Quarantined and sequestered for months.
100% bubbled.
And not once were we forced to shut production down due to a positive test.

Having my entire family and myself experienced COVID, I know first hand the transmissible strength of this insidious virus, so I pushed hard to implement these very aggressive measures.

Everything was in place to (fingers crossed🤞🏾) to succeed, but with any strategy - large or small - it’ll always come down to one thing - and that’s people rising to the challenge to commit to it.

And that’s what this crew did.

They rose to the challenge.

They accomplished something pretty extraordinary.

They raised the bar and became the gold standard.

And for that, I’m so proud of them and forever grateful for their efforts and talents.

I love you guys - now go enjoy your families, have an amazing Christmas and break open your bottles of @teremana 😊🥃

Stay healthy, DJ 🖤

・・・
I want to share parts of the conversations I’ve had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota.⁣ ⁣
The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman.⁣ ⁣
“Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The ‘knee on the neck’ is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don’t care. Truly tragic.”⁣ ⁣
Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling.⁣ ⁣
The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It’s shared by me and millions of others.⁣ ⁣
It’s natural to wish for life “to just get back to normal” as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly “normal” – whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.⁣ ⁣
This shouldn’t be “normal” in 2020 America. It can’t be “normal.” If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.⁣ ⁣
It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station – including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day – to work together to create a “new normal” in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.",2970,1593233,2020-05-29 17:48:04+00:00,Video,2020,5,29,17,Friday,2020-05-29,89473271,354,1.7839998271662605

Watching my two hometown teams @Lakers and @MiamiHeat battle for that championship ring!
They’ve sequestered in the NBA bubble away from their loved ones for 3+ months now and leaving your families is a hard thing to do in these wildly unpredictable times.

Working very closely with our series creator, Nahnatchka Khan.
She’s a brilliant (and very funny) creative partner who I trust with my wild life story growing up.

We examine every word from every character because these are all real people, real family who are still in my life and those who have passed away.

Gotta be authentic and get it right.
The good, the bad, the heartbreaking, the heartwarming and the f*cking hilarious.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"When I was a pro wrestler, I lived by an axiom - successfully sell my PPV..

Or I didn’t eat.
That forced me to come up with creative ways to “put my opponent over” to the fans leading up to my PPV.
If I can make the fans feel my passion for “laying the Smackdown on all my opponents candy asses” 🤣, then the fans would be more willing to buy the PPV.
And they did.
I’d never crap on my opponents or call them bums.
The more I put my opponent over, the better - so when I beat him - I beat somebody special.
Of course, pro wrestling is much different than MMA, but the philosophy still applies and it’s been very cool to see some @ufc fighters adopt this strategy.
Because at the end of the day, I want all @ufc fighters and @wwe wrestlers to make as much money as they possibly can.
Control the controllable’s.
Become masterful at promoting.

This time in my life may represent when I had just $7bucks in my fanny pack, but at least I had enough COOL to tuck my turtleneck in and wear fake silver jewelry because it was all I could afford 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️

And my massive plucked raised eyebrow is the stuff that dreams (and nightmares) are made of

Australia has always given me so much love and support so FIGHT ON is one way to return that love, and help provide a little bit of joy to a country that’s given me so much joy. 🤗🤗🤗 Join me at Pioneer Park Recreation Reserve in Bright, VIC on March 11.

Kendall Jenner,TV Star,3017,224,"to everyone reading this and to myself: keep researching, reading, and educating yourself on how we can become better allies.
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking these past few days and my heart has been so heavy. I’m angry and hurt just like so many. I will never personally understand the fear and pain that the black community go through on a daily basis, but i know that nobody should have to live in constant fear. I acknowledge my white privilege and promise I will continue to educate myself on how I can help. raging on platforms can not be all that we do in order to repair the system, we need to take real action, off of social media. this is a time to have those uncomfortable conversations with people and mainly with ourselves. we must also make sure we are ready to vote when the time comes to elect the right people into office.
the one truth that will always ring loudest is that BLACK LIVES MATTER. ❤️

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"I sound like a complete f’n idiot, but no HICCUPS will stop DWANTA 🥴🎅🏾🤣

For the first time in my life, I had a case of the hiccups I couldn’t shake for 30-45minutes straight 💀🤦🏾‍♂️

But Dwanta and his @teremana virtual sleigh 🛷 tour is always committed to getting the job done - hiccups and all 😊

And in the spirit of, “always getting the job done”, I’m proud to illuminate @hyruppppp, Jennifer Novak for her passionate and deeply caring work as a resident oncologist at the City of Hope Cancer Center.

Jennifer also set up a Go-FundMe account where every penny goes to helping her patients receive the treatment that they need.

And on top of all, she’s getting married, so Dwanta couldn’t help giving her future husband so VERY sage matrimonial advice...

Thank you Jennifer for being such an anchor to all your patients and their families.

Enjoy all your @teremana and gifts and MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Love,

Dwanta aka the hiccup drunk

Kourtney Kardashian,TV Star,4045,140,"It’s finally here: our Aquis x @poosh limited-edition leopard hair towel turban. This has completely rehabilitated my hair. The proprietary wicking interior fabric cuts drying time in half and helps to stop breakage and split ends. I designed the leopard print based off of one of my favorite robes growing up. You can also wear it inside-out to sleep (charmeuse against your hair), as it helps to preserve your hair style and eliminate bed head. Since using our rapid dry towel turban, I have noticed less overall breakage and more shine. I’m so excited to share one of my hair secrets with you.

“cw: homophobic/racist threats

An urgent request! I have already started to receive dozens of these. Just a reminder that 70 million + people voted for trump and many of them are extremely angry right now. After every win there is substantial backlash (in person as well as digital attacks) especially against visible minorities (trans women & femmes / Muslim women in hijabs / Black people / disabled people, etc).

While there is certainly cause for celebration, don’t lose vigilance and make sure that everyone is safe! There is heightened risk of hate violence right now!

1) Please safety plan with your friends and communities in the upcoming weeks
2) Make sure especially to check-in with your trans women / trans femme friends who are navigating public space if they need support. We are often the most visible in public and the most forgotten during these moments.
3) Please remind people about the reality of hate violence (especially during times of celebration media under reports these incidents)”",2811,291936,2020-11-07 20:28:54+00:00,Photo,2020,11,7,20,Saturday,2020-11-07,93317587,184,0.31585364503692104

・・・
The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is an essential service to the animals and people in our community.⠀
⠀
Shelter & Intake: We are staying open to accept and adopt animals. Due to COVID-19, we are receiving an influx of animals - owned pets because people can’t afford their care and strays because animals are lost or abandoned. THE ANIMALS NEED US NOW MORE THAN EVER!⠀
⠀
Animal Hospital: Animals get sick and injured just like people. It is imperative that sick and injured animals receive the medical care that they NEED. Our full-service hospital will remain open to treat the public’s animals.⠀
⠀
Food Assistance: We are still providing dog and cat food to the public through our food assistance and Animeals programs to help Tampa Bay citizens who are struggling.⠀
⠀
Action Items: We urge the public to please CONTINUE TO ADOPT from our shelter so that we have enough space to continue to intake animals. When coming to our shelter and animal hospital please be mindful of the new policies we have in place to adhere to the CDC guidelines, the Executive Order issued by the Governor as well as the County Administrator. This will include a longer wait time and completing your adoption paperwork outside.⠀
⠀
If you have any questions, please contact communications@humanesocietytampa.org⠀

La #donacióndemédulaósea es ofrecer tu ayuda anónima y desinteresada a cualquier paciente del mundo que lo necesite. Es un compromiso con uno mismo y con todos los IMPARABLES. Es la única cura posible para las personas que la necesitan. Es dar VIDA.

La donación de médula ósea no es nada relacionado con tu médula espinal. La médula ósea es nuestra “fábrica de la sangre” y se encuentra en nuestros huesos largos, no en la médula espinal. No es una intervención que elimine tu médula ósea, se regenera completamente en cuestión de días. No es dar para otro y luego no poder dar si un familiar tuyo lo requiere. Podés dar varias veces. No es inscribirte como donante exclusivamente para una persona, sino para cualquier IMPARABLE del mundo. No es peligroso para el donante.

En el momento en el que te registrás no estás donando médula ósea, sino que te toman una muestra de ADN (sangre o saliva) para poder analizar tu HLA y poder tenerte en cuenta en cada búsqueda.

¿Cómo sabrás si sos el donante compatible para salvar la vida de un paciente? Te llamarán desde la Fundación Josep Carreras para comunicártelo. Es importante que tengan tus datos actualizados para poder localizarte. Realizarán algunas pruebas médicas para asegurarse de que sos el donante ideal y, si lo sos, entonces se establecerá la fecha para la donación. El método de la donación se decide teniendo en cuenta la preferencia del donante y las necesidades específicas del paciente.

Podés leer más sobre la donación de médula ósea en www.fcarreras.org/donamedula

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"📚💌 Here’s an excerpt from the powerful November & December @oursharedshelf letter written by Brittney Cooper (@professor_crunk) & Rebecca Traister.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“Dear Our Shared Shelf Readers,
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We are honored to be able to begin a conversation with you about the power and consequence of women’s rage, both personal and political. We could not be prouder or more excited that Audre Lorde’s Sister Outsider, Brittney Cooper’s Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower, and Rebecca Traister’s Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger have been selected as the Our Shared Shelf books for November/December 2018.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The famed feminist activist, poet, and essayist Audre Lorde was one of the foremost thinkers on the importance of anger. In her essay, “The Uses of Anger,” which you will get to read in her book Sister Outsider, she wrote, “every woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions, personal and institutional, which brought that anger into being. Focused with precision it can become a powerful source of energy serving progress and change.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To encounter these words is to be changed by them. We have been changed by them. And we hope that women’s anger, put to use within progressive coalitions in which fury is expressed and treated as instructive, will in turn have the power to change the world.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In this period, as we reckon with the rise of hard right authoritarian regimes around the world, many determined to roll back human rights—the very freedoms generations of angry women before us worked to win—today’s women are again being called to embrace our rage–its force, its potential, its messy complications. The fight against global patriarchy is far from over. Violence abounds but so does the possibility of building a new world from the wreckage of the old one.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"“For both men and women the first step in getting power is to become visible to others, and then to put on an impressive show. . . . As women achieve power, the barriers will fall. As society sees what women can do, as women see what women can do, there will be more women out there doing things, and we’ll all be better off for it.” -Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Ok so anytime a clear bag comes into my possession, the first question that comes to mind is: if I put an Almond Joy in this bag, will that disgust and detract potential robbers? Kidding. That’s the second question. The first is: can this be an aquarium? And if so, for what? In this case, the answer is YES! The Katy Perry pineapple tote can 1000% house 3 yellowtail trout comfortably. Alert Vogue! I know, I know - you’re thinking “wow, I never knew Harry was into marine biology.” And you’re probably right (although I eat a lot of seaweed and think Sara Paxton and Emma Roberts were AMAZING in Aquamarine, a marine biology classic). But I AM into @katyperry and her @katyperrycollections bags! And I’m delighted that they decided to hooketteuppe with a new fish tank. Err, tote. 😘

Speaking of Katy Perry, she just gave birth to DAISY BLOOM, her first child with Orlando Bloom! Head over to @unicef (ok random acts of charity queen) to see their birth announcement! Katy if you ever need someone to babysit 😉 kidding but I can totally find you a sitter cuz I don’t do babies lol ⁣

This kid @adriangroulx is our anchor and my hero 👊🏾

He’s got the hardest job of ‘em of all playing “little Dewey” - yes, unfortunately that was the nickname my God parents gave me after the weather - as in dewdrops.

Jesus. 🤦🏽‍♂️😂

At 10yrs old, I was rambunctious as all hell 😈, was already girl crazy 😜 and loved pro wrestling — especially the part when wrestlers would bleed 🩸🥴💀🤣

This kid, Adrian is my hero because I look back at this time in my life so fondly and how I viewed the world thru my 10yr old eyes.

I was all these things but at the core I was a sweet little boy and a complicated little cub 🐻 who just needed guidance.

Years later here we are and I did alright 🙏🏾👊🏾

This passion project is special and I’m boundless grateful to EVERYONE who is lending their talents, passion, love and mana to bring it to life.

Can’t wait for you guys to watch this one!

My dreams of playing in the NFL never came true, but now years later - I have the honor of buying an entire pro football league so the dreams of other players CAN COME TRUE.
My trailblazing partner @danygarciaco (first woman ever to own an entire US sports league) and #GerryCardinale are passionate football owners who are committed to the grind to deliver awesome football for the fans — and always take care of our hard working, talented players.
And finally, I keep a framed $7 BUCKS (the amount of money I had when I was cut from the Canadian Football League in 1995) on the top shelf here as my daily reminder to stay hungry, humble and always be the hardest worker in the room.

For our globe trotting movie, RED NOTICE we were all set to film at the famed museum CASTEL SANT’ ANGELO, in Rome, Italy.

When the pandemic shut our world down - we regrouped, re-strategized and decided the show must go on.

So we built the museum ourselves.

As producer, I’m extremely proud of our hungry and brilliant/
Production designer
Art directors
Construction teams
Set decorators

And ALL OF OUR CREW who accepted this daunting challenge during COVID of coming back to finish what we started.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Back to work we go. Disciplined, cautious, optimistic.

Like so many of us here in the US and around the world - getting back can be a tough decision that work requires real consideration and strategic planning around best health practices and safety measures.
I’m happy to announce our RED NOTICE production will resume shooting next month in mid September.
Thank you to our tremendous partners at NETFLIX who’ve joined us shoulder to shoulder to provide the safest and most aggressive “quarantined bubble” for our production crew as possible.
I’m confident in our safety strategy and execution, but we’ll also be fluid and amenable to best practice changes on the fly.
Stay healthy and stay disciplined, my friends as you all get back to work.
Good luck!
And to my RED NOTICE crew - the hardest workers in the room, mount up - because we’re going back to work.
See you on set.

Justin Timberlake,Musician,751,887,"Last night - in celebration of pride- a group of people - people like you or me or your neighbors or family were dancing & listening to music & celebrating life, just like you or me or your neighbors would. And then, one man and his guns took that life away from them. That's cruel. And it's exactly against what America stands for. I try to make music that hopefully brings joy to people and makes people dance and makes people feel and makes people LOVE... Because there's nothing more pure and beautiful than that act- and the fact that that resulted in the largest mass shooting in American history leaves me heartbroken. I used to LIVE there. I hope we can wake up and realize we are ALL THE SAME. Just humans. One species. Just wanting to be LOVED.

Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of our industry says otherwise,” Blanchett said, reading from a statement written by her and legendary director Agnes Varda, who delivered the speech in French. “As women, we all face our own unique challenges, but we stand together on these steps today as a symbol of our determination and our commitment to progress. We are writers, we are producers, we are directors, actresses, cinematographers, talent agents, editors, distributors, sales agents, and all of us are involved in the cinematic arts. And we stand today in solidarity with women of all industries.
_
We expect our institutions to actively provide parity and transparency in their executive bodies and provide safe environments in which to work,” Blanchett continued. “We expect our governments to make sure that the laws of equal pay for equal work are upheld. We demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so that they can best reflect the world in which we actually live. A world that allows all of us in front and behind the camera, all of us, to thrive shoulder to shoulder with our male colleagues.

Gigi Hadid,Model,3130,1191,"Enraged. Sickened. Heartbroken. But never surprised. This happens way too often - and the videos that go viral are not isolated events. It seems that only when caught on camera are bigots & MURDERERS even getting “investigated” or fired .. unfortunately, the only way things will start changing is if all these racist, ignorant, monsters (badge &/or not) have to face the consequences- behind bars. && it’s not only an issue with black men being killed by cops ... it’s an issue every time we see them being treated, in even non-violent situations, VERY CLEARLY differently than many very-high-risk incidents involving white men; it’s an issue that the President is making dangerous public statements about enforcing the shooting of protesters -rightfully angered by another UNNEEDED KILLING of another black person & DEMANDING JUSTICE WHERE IT IS 100% NEEDED- while exactly 28 days earlier, he tweeted about white protesters, who stood ARMED WITH GUNS protesting a WORLDWIDE HEALTH PANDEMIC as “very good people” urging the Governor to “See them, talk to them, make a deal.” ?????????? This is, too, an issue about the “Karen’s” we see filmed weekly- using someone’s race, as a point to try and push their agenda, while calling the police in situations where their lives are clearly not actually in danger at all..... they’re just plain f***ing racist. EVERY. TIME. feels more disheartening and nauseating because our cries for the Government and Americans to do better seem unheard; but even when we feel like what we do isn’t enough or can’t help, we have to do more. Keep signing petitions, making calls to demand justice, speaking out (this is not just if you have a big platform- it starts in your homes and communities), and fighting to make a difference for every life that has been wrongly taken or effected by THE PANDEMIC OF RACISM. THIS IS ABOUT BEING AGAINST EVERY SENSELESS ACT OF DISCRIMINATION THAT BURDENS THIS COUNTRY.",61289,1177619,2020-05-29 17:16:51+00:00,Photo,2020,5,29,17,Friday,2020-05-29,54288733,327,2.2820720461462973

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"🆘 With the awareness generated by #metoo, there is an increased demand for support services as more people are emboldened to name what happened to them.❣️Rape Crisis Centres❣️offer much-needed support to people who have been assaulted across England and Wales (@rapecrisisew), but demand way outstrips supply.❗️This time last year, there were 6,355 survivors on Rape Crisis waiting lists and these can be as long as 14 months.‼️ This means that if a survivor calls to look for support they may be turned away...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⌛️💷 Successive UK governments have failed to fund life-saving services. There are just 44 Rape Crisis Centres in England and Wales. 🎯 But the Istanbul Convention (which our Government will soon ratify) sets out a minimum provision of support for victims of rape which would require that there be 150 Rape Crisis Centres in England and Wales. 🚨 It’s simply unacceptable that a country like mine falls so far short of the minimum standards set across Europe.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
📋❤️✍🏻 So on #IWD2019, I encourage you to sign Fern’s petition 👆🏻LINK IN BIO👆🏻and demand that Theresa May guarantees sustained 💰 funding for rape crisis support services, 💌 so the survivors of sexual violence can access the support they need. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🔗📋✍🏻 tinyurl.com/FernsPetition
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
💪🏻👩🏼 These are the words of 25-year-old Fern Champion, who was raped in 2016 and has launched a petition 💌 asking the Prime Minister to ensure that specialist rape counselling support is always available for everyone who seeks it:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻 💔 “By not adequately funding support services this Government is telling survivors that their recovery does not matter and by extension that they do not matter. When you have been raped, the vital, life-saving counselling should just be there when you need it.” 🙌🏻❤️👏🏻

A kind man.

And kindness matters.

Patrick you’ve taken care of our health care workers in your community — and now I’d like to take care of you.

My partners at @vossworld and myself have a few special things coming your way this week.

Thanks, Patrick for being such an inspiration to all of us and proving that regardless of all the noise - kindness will always cut thru and matter most.

Because a drop of kindness, goes a long way.

Ps, lunch is me - all year long🎅🏾😉

Thank YOU to every creative collaborator involved on this project! If one person was missing I would not be writing this message. @billboard

To my fucking idols @joanjett @billyidol and @stevienicks your blessing, guidance, inspiration , and validation mean everything to me. Even though you 3 would tell me I do not need validation from anyone but my fucking self. The confidence I have in who I am / what I am doing stems from the values instilled by looking up to you as my role models from the beginning.

JJ, I have you to thank for my love of leather, playing music at an unholy level of loud, and my uncompromising sense of self. I fucking love you.

Stevie,
Your words have been coming out of my mouth since I can remember .... but mine flowing from yours is still surreal. Your generosity is unrivaled. Thank you for lending your magic! I am forever your “smiley baby”.... I love you

BILLY FUCKING IDOL!
We’ve been “rebel yelling” since 2012 when I brought a photo of you to the salon and said “I wanna look like that”. You are brazen, bold, unapologetic, and authentic in a way that is my honor to witness . I appreciate you deeply.

TO MY NEWEST FRIEND, @DUALIPA -
Thank you for allowing me to cover you in cherry juice, lick your face and for playing at a dirty rock club w me! You’re fearlessness is all that could outshine you’re fabulousness. I love you forever.

Shawn Mendes,Musician,2350,1150,"I’m thinking about being in 9th grade right now. The day after I posted one of my first covers onto YouTube back in 2014.. at school walking down the hall straight into a group of older guys yelling out “sing for me Shawn sing for me!” In a way that made me feel absolutely horrible... made me feel like a joke, like what I was doing was just stupid & wrong.
I was lucky though, I had the best friends & the best parents anyone could ask for... no matter what they would never let me stop doing what I LOVED to do just because someone ELSE thought it was stupid.
It’s not joke to me. To make someone feel bad about doing what they love... every single person deserves to do what makes them feel alive.
I’m writing this not only to the 15 year old kid who’s scared to follow their heart because of what people might say but also to the 50 year old who may be doing the exact same thing.
I know it’s not just that easy & I’m not asking you to change your world over night, BUT I want you to know that no matter how old you are, no matter who you are, no matter where you’re from... you deserve to follow your heart

It’s my privilege to speak eye to eye with our entire crew to help give a little clarity and guidance, as the most important thing right now is for us to get everyone home to their concerned families.
Gotta protect our babies, spouses, loved ones and elderly.
We’ll continue to monitor and assess this situation closely to make the best decisions for our families first and then our businesses.
We’re a resilient nation who ultimately, will always rise to the occasion to be accountable and work together to overcome whatever hardship lies in front of us.
Our country will do its job, as the rest of the world will do theirs.
Everyone please stay healthy, vigilant, safe and let’s protect one another.
We’re all in this - together.

Selena Gomez,Musician,1692,153,"Please meet Raquel Willis (@raquel_willis). Raquel is an activist, soon-to-be author, and media strategist dedicated to building the power of Black transgender people. She began her career as a newspaper journalist, and eventually began working with other Black trans organizers at Solutions Not Punishments Collaborative (@Snap4Freedom) to develop campaigns to support Black trans people being profiled by police in Atlanta. Her talents led her to Transgender Law Center (@translawcenter) where she founded Black Trans Circles (@blacktranscircles_tlc), a project focused on healing justice for Black trans women in the Southern and Midwestern United States. She is also the former executive editor of Out magazine, where she created The Trans Obituaries Project dedicated to elevating the stories of slain trans women of color. She is currently working on an essay collection about her life experiences and activism called The Risk It Takes to Bloom.⠀
⠀
Raquel believes in the power of storytelling and digital organizing as elements of radical change. She believes that the world can learn a great deal from Black transgender people because we are all limited by restrictive notions of gender. “Black trans people are a window of possibility for the men and boys who struggle to express their emotions and be tender, to the women and girls who struggle to be seen as smart and capable leaders, to everyone in between struggles within all simultaneously—you deserve to be complicated and human.”⠀

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"RIP brother.
Really saddened to wake up to this news yesterday— the passing of my friend, Joe Laurinaitis (on the left) aka ROAD WARRIOR ANIMAL.
Joe & Mike aka HAWK & ANIMAL, THE ROAD WARRIORS were the most intense, legit tough bad asses tag team in the history of the wild world of pro wrestling.
When I was making my bones, still learning the business in the WWE as a very young “The Rock” - I wrestled these guys so many times on the road and they always took good care of me and made sure I learned.
Tough as nails.
Good men.
Greatest tag team of all time.
And apple fritters (our inside joke).
Much love and I’ll always be grateful to you both.
RIP.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Great @projectrock fan question about bouncing back after losing motivation

I get it and we’ve all been there. Some days we’re razor sharp and focused, while other days we’re a bit wobbly and might even lose our IT.
Try your best to identify the core issue.
Get laser focused on the stuff you can control.
Your effort and the work you put in with your own two hands.
Rise up. Go.
Good luck.
Thanks for the question and enjoy the gear.

Jennifer Lopez,Musician,3004,1189,"When we heard about the students and amazing teachers at Jacksboro Elementary in Tennessee, we knew we had to help.  We heard teachers were helping students bring home food when they didn't have enough.  When we saw this story, it brought tears not just to my eyes, but Alex's as well!  I don’t know if you guys know, but Alex and I are part owners in a company called Tiller & Hatch, and we decided to donate a years worth of of their yummy, healthy meals, for the students and their school’s food pantry. 🍽✨ This is why being a business owner, and having actual ownership in companies (not licensing), is so important to me and Alex, especially as Latinos. It's about showing our community, this is what life can be. You can take charge and take ownership. It allows us to have a say in creating things that make people's lives better and have partners that share our passion for giving back. Because giving back and being there for others is really what matters most ❤️❤️❤️ We are happy to be in business with partners who also believe no child should EVER have to go to sleep hungry. Everyone should have access to delicious, nutritious food.

He was always watching and always with us everytime we played, I can still hear him telling me NO MORE HOLLYWOOD PASSES. I can still see him as we played on The Cliff training ground looking down on us either with a proud smile or a loud bang of his fist on the window knowing any minute he would be on his way down to probably advise me in the most polite way to stop playing those passes. More importantly he made us understand how to work hard and respect each other and not just on the pitch. We won’t forget the life lessons he gave us.

Follow the steps above to make sure your ballot is good to go.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Merry Christmas, Bruno 🎅🏾 Love you, brother! 100% crackhead free 👹😊

My life (especially my teenage years) has been full of the wildest twists and turns - yet God and the universe had always found a way to put a few people in my path that would change the trajectory of the road I was going down.

Meet one of my lifelong friends, Bruno Lauer — or I prefer to call him, “Downtown Bruno” 😉 🤟🏾

My mom and I were evicted off the island of Hawaii and I was sent to Nashville, Tennessee to live with my dad.

When I landed in Nashville, I quickly found out I wasn’t gonna live with my dad.

Shit happens, plans change and that’s the way it goes.

Instead, I told I was gonna live with a guy named Bruno. Who at the time lived in a tiny room at a spot called the Alamo Plaza motel.

Bruno could’ve (and should’ve) said hell no, I’m not takin’ in some kid who I don’t know.

But he didn’t.

He took this punk kid in and we became lifelong friends.

Then ironically - about 9 years later when I had the infamous “$7 Bucks” in my pocket - I started my wrestling career in Memphis, Tennessee and AGAIN - had no place to live and Bruno took me and let me shake up in his trailer, til I could get on my feet.

And hell, when I was 15yrs old, Bruno even gave me his last $40 bucks so I could hustle a crackhead out of his car one night at a honky tonk in Nashville 😈🤦🏾‍♂️

But the hustle was on me, because when I took off down the road there was a SECOND CRACKHEAD passed out on the floor in the back! 👹

Wild times at 15yrs old.

Merry Christmas, Bruno and since you helped me “buy” my first car - I figured I could return the favor and buy you one that 100% does NOT have a crackhead in the back seat.

I love you, brother.

Your kindness and heart - helped change my life’s trajectory.

And when you’re ready to retire from “the business” you just say the word.

I got you covered.

We’ll go “downtown” 🤟🏾

Enjoy your new ride and give Walls, Mississippi my love and gratitude 🖤

It’s a good day when my friend and A cam 🎥 operator, Geoff Haley makes me belly laugh - no doubt from his filthy, inappropriate jokes my innocent ears should not be hearing.
Over the years, the biggest movies of my career have been shot by Geoff, who was just awarded “Operator of the Year” (equivalent to winning an Academy Award) for his brilliant camera work on JOKER.
He’s a phenomenal storyteller behind the lens and this summer we’re pumped to collaborate again on our highly anticipated, BLACK ADAM⚡️
DC Universe, we’re excited to come play.
Until then, it’s back to work on this one.

This is what happens when the votes of communities of color are actively suppressed by state governments. Organizations like @blackvotersmtr & @workingfamilies are leading the charge in ensuring these voter suppression efforts fail. We do this by talking to voters about the issues and getting them to the ballot box. You can join @workingfamilies efforts to get out the vote by texting WFP to 30403. ⠀

Kendall Jenner,TV Star,3017,224,"While there are much bigger problems happening in the world, suffering from acne for me was debilitating. It’s something that I’ve dealt with since I was a young teen and has caused me to feel anxious, helpless and insecure. As humans, I don’t think we share our insecurities enough because we live in a time where being “perfect” is the standard. We curate our life online and pick the pretty moments to post. I’d like to show a younger generation that not everything is perfect. Being insecure about my acne gave me thick skin but I wouldn’t ever wish that feeling upon anyone so after trying countless options, I found something that has been helpful in maintaining clear skin for me. It’s been a long journey but I’m excited for where my skin is now. I didn’t think I’d see the day where I would feel confident posting a makeup free picture. My goal is to open up a dialogue around skin positivity. ❤️",2121,2447383,2019-01-17 23:49:16+00:00,Photo,2019,1,17,23,Thursday,2019-01-17,98824020,172,2.4786524571657784

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Another very productive work week on set of RED NOTICE 🙏🏾

* Some very cool Hollywood intel for all you cinephiles out there 🎥

I’m gonna sound like a big technology nerd but the hell with it, here we go🤓

The small @panavisionofficial camera on the right in this picture thats on a slider, on top of a wooden apple box is using one of the most prolific Hollywood lenses of all time.

It’s an ultra Panatar anamorphic lens. The same glass that shot BEN HUR (1959) and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962). 60+ year old glass with beautiful quirks and distortions and a unique bokeh.

Old school shit — they literally don’t (and can’t!) make them like this anymore. We’ve coupled these lenses with the most cutting edge digital technology in the world — Red’s 8k Monstro — to achieve a look that’s both old school Hollywood & new school slick. No one’s photographed a film with this combo before — until RED NOTICE.

A special shout to our brilliant/hungry cinematographer @markusforderer for his unique and groundbreaking vision.

We’re making a great one.

The world’s most wanted art thief.
An FBI profiler.
And the greatest conman the world has ever seen.

Gigi Hadid,Model,3130,1191,"Repost @vmagazine : Gigi Journal Part II is here! Presenting a medley of innovative art and fresh perspectives, by artists derived from over 20,000 submissions, the journal serves as a reflection of the events we are all experiencing through its theme: Quaranti(m)e: Your Experience in Quarantine / Honoring Essential Workers. Initially conceived to document creatiVity in quarantine, the journal expanded once the revival of the #BlackLivesMatter movement reignited. As @gigihadid explains as part of her Editor’s Letter, “With only about a week left til this journal’s deadline, at the height of [BLM] protests in the US and around the globe, I felt strongly that it was [our] responsibility to amplify Black-American voices using this platform and privilege.” Available now for pre-order, the journal features Gigi’s hand-painted cover art and 32 exclusive pieces from artists around the globe, as well as written contributions from leaders in the racial-justice movement. Truly a one-of-a-kind hardbound keepsake, the journal’s covers have been printed with solar activated and glow-in-the-dark ink!⁣
⁣
The journal also strives to give back: a percentage of the proceeds will be split among four organizations: @blklivesmatter, @naacp, @aclu_nationwide, and @campaignzero (Gigi has also pledged to match that amount with a personal donation). ⁣

Demi Lovato,Musician,317,691,"This is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it’s CELLULIT!!!! I’m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited - and I hate that I did that but it’s the truth) so that others think I’m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it’s just not me. This is what I got. I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else’s standards. So here’s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day. It’s such a great feeling to be back in tv/film while not stressing myself with a strenuous workout schedule before 14 hour days, or depriving myself from a real birthday cake rather than opting for watermelon & whip cream with candles because I was terrified of REAL cake and was miserable on some crazy diet shit. Anyway, here’s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me. And you should love you too! Now back to the studio.. I’m working on an anthem.. 🙏🏼🙌🏼🤷🏻‍♀️ also. Just so everyone’s clear.. I’m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that’s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too. 💗 #nationalcelulliteday #celluLIT 🔥🔥🔥",331786,10034765,2019-09-06 00:30:29+00:00,Photo,2019,9,6,0,Friday,2019-09-06,69599702,257,14.894533600158232

Hey Y'all! this is @MsLaToshaBrown here! I am Co-founder and Chief Doer of @BlackVotersMtr

I'm so excited that today Demi is allowing me to take over her IG page so I can talk about the work of Black Voters Matter Fund.

We are a power-building organization based in Atlanta, Georgia that is committed to building the capacity of Black led community organizations all across the country.  

Currently we are working throughout the state of Georgia to organize voters to return to the polls for the January 5th US Senate runoff election.

We are providing funding resources to 60+ groups across the state of Georgia, organizing in more than 50 counties and contacting through our outreach efforts to millions of Georgia voters.

All of BVM's work is rooted in the idea that we can both SPREAD LOVE and BUILD POWER! We are out here in these streets in the Blackest bus in America spreading some holiday joy and reminding our communities that WE HAVE POWER!

Learn more about our work at BlackVotersMatterFund.org

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Alriiiight I’ll admit, seeing this post from my mama @atajohnson got me emo.
This is a very old traditional song about my grandfather’s village in Samoa. FALEALILI.
Then to see my daughters feel their mana in their blood with their grammy showcasing our culture makes my ol’ heart swell with love 🖤
Then to realize today’s my late grandfather’s birthday made this whole thing heavenly.
Beautiful to see in such uncertain times.
This one’s for you grandpa.
Rest in love & happy birthday High Chief 🥃 🌺🇼🇸

On this beautiful Atlanta morning my granddaughters and I were outside playing & dancing their version of the siva to their favourite samoan song, 🎸 Minoi Minoi Minoi 🎼
Suddenly, “FALEALILI” filled the air...the beautiful traditional song of the village of Falealili, my late father’s village! And as my heart skipped a beat, it dawned on me today is his birthday in heaven.
Love you Mum & Daddy! Manuia lou aso fanau Daddy ❤️

I was gonna sing this for ya, but it’s too late and the babies are sleeping but I can sure as hell 😈 can write it/
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it 'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
Start drinkin’ Teremana
Calling every woman mama
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some beautiful wreck
And brother I can name you a few
But I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it 'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do.
Happy birthday, brother Willie.

Repost @vmagazine: V Magazine is proud and excited to welcome @gigihadid to our CreatiVity panel! With her longtime passion for researching, discovering and following the work of visual artists (of any & ALL mediums!) on Instagram, Gigi will partner with V Magazine to spotlight new artists for her next #TheGigiJournal, starting with a talent-search between today, April 15th & May 20th! We want to help broadcast art and its creators, from around the globe, that we think deserve celebrating! The selected artists, culminating in a list of chosen winners and announced at the end of the 5 week period, will be given a profile in the Gigi Journal alongside a new piece of their work, creative directed in collaboration with Gigi, for our upcoming Fall issue!

This will also include profiles and projects produced with some of Gigi’s longtime favorite creatives she’s followed over the years! In our continuous effort to give hope back to the world, V Magazine is excited to have Gigi share her unique voice and platform to help support young and/or undiscovered artists.

Do you want to be a part of this project? Help us find you!
Here are some guidelines:
1) Be sure to tag #CREATIVITYXGIGI in your caption BEFORE May 20, 2020!
2) Your Instagram will need to feature multiple pieces of work (from any medium of art) for review
3) Follow @vmagazine & @gigihadid to be contacted via DM

Good Luck!",2971,3132207,2020-04-15 21:45:18+00:00,Video,2020,4,15,21,Wednesday,2020-04-15,52907778,278,5.9257412019835725

Here’s my boy @adamraycomedy havin’ some fun with his crowd.
Interacting with a crowd is always one of my fav things to do - always fun.
I love when comedians break from their act and interact with the audience (Richard Pryor was the best at it)
Takes a real skill set to work a crowd and Adam is a always funny as hell with this stuff.

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"One of the several challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic globally has been its impact on the education system. With classrooms going online for the immediate future, there is still uncertainty over what school will look like in the months to come. This uncertainty takes on another meaning for many girls around the world… the question isn’t when they will return to school—it’s if they will return at all. Due to ripple effects from COVID-19, experts predict that tens of millions more adolescent girls could remain out of school forever. We cannot let this happen.  

I urge you to read the new op-ed by @MichelleObama and @MelindaFrenchGates (link in my bio) about how we can all support them and then take immediate action with the @GirlsOpportunityAlliance at gofundme.com/girlsopportunityalliance. Together, we can ensure that girls continue to pursue their education and dream their dreams… because when girls get the education they deserve, our whole world benefits.",1148,250005,2020-08-07 16:17:02+00:00,Photo,2020,8,7,16,Friday,2020-08-07,55854945,163,0.44965221969156

But first, MAHALO 🙏🏾🤙🏾 for making our @teremana brand the most exciting and fastest growing tequila in the market.
Two things were critically important to me in producing this tequila/
QUALITY.
Highest in quality, produces best in taste.
Small batch, slow roasted in brick ovens and made by hand.
The right way.
ACCESSIBILITY.
Teremana prides itself on being, “the tequila of the people” so I set the price point to make sure that EVERYONE could afford it.
The People’s Tequila.
Now go enjoy your frosty Strawberry Manarita!

Emma Watson,Actor,222,51,"I’m hopeful we’ll hear some concrete, bold commitments from @G7 states, especially @10DowningStreet 🇬🇧 at #G7Biarritz. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🌎 One of the basic things we're asking states to do is ratify all relevant gender equality standards: http://bit.ly/GEACfrance 🌍 There are some incredible global treaties and conventions that set minimum standards for women's and girls’ rights 🥀 but some G7 states haven’t yet stepped up and made them a reality. #BeBraveG7 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
💔🇬🇧 On a personal note, the fact that the UK has still not ratified the Istanbul Convention, despite signing it in 2012, is really disappointing to me. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⚖️ For those who haven’t heard of it before, the Istanbul Convention is an agreement that makes governments responsible for combating violence against women and domestic violence. It’s focussed on preventing violence, protecting survivors and prosecuting accused offenders. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🌹I’ll be proud to say my country is committed to preventing violence against women when the UK government ratifies the Istanbul Convention and fully complies with its requirements. Every week, two women in England and Wales are killed by their current or former partner. Violence against women and girls is one of the most serious human rights issues in the UK. To date, 34 states in the Council of Europe have ratified the Istanbul Convention. 📝❤️ Let’s not drag our feet on this any longer, @10DowningStreet!

Kim Kardashian,TV Star,5373,117,"40 and feeling so humbled and blessed. There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when we are all reminded of the things that truly matter. For my birthday this year, I couldn’t think of a better way to spend it than with some of the people who have helped shaped me into the woman I am today. Before COVID, I don’t think any of us truly appreciated what a simple luxury it was to be able to travel and be together with family and friends in a safe environment. After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time. We danced, rode bikes, swam near whales, kayaked, watched a movie on the beach and so much more. I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is. #thisis40",33560,6052937,2020-10-27 17:59:58+00:00,Photo,2020,10,27,17,Tuesday,2020-10-27,190771178,190,3.1904698937278675

・・・
I want to share with you some joyful news. On Monday, I became a father. This is Wyatt Cooper. He is three days old. He is named after my father, who died when I was ten. I hope I can be as good a dad as he was. My son's middle name is Morgan. It's a family name on my mom's side. I know my mom and dad liked the name morgan because I recently found a list they made 52 years ago when they were trying to think of names for me. Wyatt Morgan Cooper. My son. He was 7.2 lbs at birth, and he is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy.

As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I’m grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son's birth.
Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him. It is an extraordinary blessing - what she, and all surrogates give to families who cant have children. My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives

I do wish my mom and dad and my brother, Carter, were alive to meet Wyatt, but I like to believe they can see him. I imagine them all together, arms around each other, smiling and laughing, happy to know that their love is alive in me and in Wyatt, and that our family continues.",30757,1496896,2020-05-01 04:44:31+00:00,Photo,2020,5,1,4,Friday,2020-05-01,88579630,318,1.7246098228226965

I am so grateful to be able to take back my days from migraine. Other people are too, and we’re using #TakeBackToday to share our stories.

See safety info here: @nurtecodt_pi. For the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Not a preventive treatment. Do not take Nurtec ODT if allergic to Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) or its ingredients.

Khloé Kardashian,TV Star,3879,132,"☾ 2019, Im happily saying goodbye

They tell you that you shouldn’t look back but I’m going to suggest that you do. Be brave, look back and reflect on your past year; Or the past decade! It’s OK to remind yourself of what you went through and what you overcame.
We may not be able to control what happens to us but we can control how we react to it. We must remember that all things are powerless unless we give them power. So let that power be empathy, understanding, kindness, grace, love and respect. Remember that God has and always will have your back. Have faith that life will get better as long as we believe in ourselves. We must internally feel grateful for everything and strive to become better people daily.

Remind yourself how incredible your life is. How you’re still standing, thriving, smiling. Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that what we take with us, is so much greater than what we left behind.
I am choosing to only take with me the happiest of times! As I made this video of the past year; I can’t help but smile! True you are my entire heart! My happy place! My Forever and always! I love you ♡

I pray you leave everything that does not serve you purpose, happiness, peace, love and health back in 2019.

2020 I welcome you with all of my heart!! ☾ 🎶 Des’ree- I’m kissing you",14527,1986432,2020-01-01 04:03:13+00:00,Photo,2020,1,1,4,Wednesday,2020-01-01,103109284,247,1.9406196245141225

Cristiano Ronaldo,Athlete,2982,459,"2020 was not an easy year, there’s no doubt about it. No one can be indifferent to the pain and suffering that COVID-19 brought upon the world.

But now it’s time to bounce back and show that, together, we can make a difference. Because no matter how hard is the fall, what really defines us is the way we get back on our feet and how fast we are ready to face new obstacles.

So let’s try to turn 2021 into a turning point, a new beggining, a fresh start. Because all of us – and I do mean all of us – can still become better versions of ourselves. And if we do it all together, that might actually be the secret to turn things around for the better.

Happy New Year! And may 2021 be a year to allways remember for the best reasons! 🙏🏽❤️",47502,7759764,2020-12-31 20:13:36+00:00,Photo,2020,12,31,20,Thursday,2020-12-31,250330501,148,3.1187833559283296

Vin Diesel,Actor,1653,64,"So much to tell you... so much to share... as you know, we have been filming in Scotland. We threw a party for the crew last night in appreciation for all of their hard work. It was one of those moments that so often in the past we were together smiling and getting everyone drunk, especially Justin. Haha. Who by the way would make you so proud with what he is accomplishing with this film. Nathalie was there, in her loving spirit. Oh, and John Cena was there, who you would just love. His gratitude is palpable... and knowing you, you would just want him to win. This week the studio came to meet about the next chapter, your ears were ringing again. You would have gotten a kick out of the fact that we met in a chapel. It was profound... normally today I would be planning how to embarrass you with a birthday cake. Haha. Instead I reflect on how lucky I am to call you my brother. The tears never go away, but they change... from that of mourning to that of grace. We only hope to make you proud. Speaking of which, guess what message I woke up to... your daughter. Meadow sending me love on this day. Wow, she knows me so well. She has your heart.

Did you know that these products are enriched rose extracts from England? All the products in this range are super nourishing & smell like roses. My absolute favourites are the British Rose body butter and body yogurt. Both the products provide 48-Hour moisturisation and the yogurt absorbs in literally in 15 seconds.

This range is an absolute must-have for the month of love!

With gratitude & passion I’ve built a career with my own two hands and will apply these callouses to building our @xfl brand to create something special for the fans.
My dreams of playing professional football never came true, however - this passion venture allows me to create opportunities for other players to showcase their talents, take care of their families and make their own dreams come true.
Now, my partners and I go to work - for the love of football.

I’m so honored to be part of today’s global effort to support the @armeniafund. I’ve been speaking out about the current situation in Armenia and Artsakh and having conversations with so many others to bring further awareness to the crisis that we cannot allow to advance.

My thoughts and prayers are with the brave men, women and children. I want everyone to remember that despite the distance that separates us, we are not limited by borders and we are one global Armenian nation together.

The @armeniafund is directly helping those that have been impacted during this critical time with humanitarian aid through food, shelter, and medical care.

I will be donating $1M to assist their efforts on the ground and invite you to join me. Whether you are helping with just raising awareness and posting on social media or donating just $1, every bit helps.

Let’s make this our most successful fundraiser ever.

Thank you so much. 🇦🇲 ❤️💙🧡",306631,19922588,2020-10-10 20:01:10+00:00,Video,2020,10,10,20,Saturday,2020-10-10,189853293,167,10.655184685155817

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"“My grandmother, who helped me grow even though she had nothing, she did everything she could to send me to school and for me to reach here. I haven’t been able to support her at all and I left her all by herself in Eritrea,” said Simon 16, who arrived in Ethiopia as an unaccompanied minor seeking asylum when he was 14. He never knew his parents. Eritrean refugees account for the one of the largest groups of refugees in Ethiopia, with more than 2,400 being unaccompanied minors. Simon made the journey alone and had to sleep at the border that night. Then, he stayed at the registration center for 2 months before they moved him to the Hitsats Refugee Camp...he’s been there for 2 years and 3 months now, and “life is really good compared to where I was,” he told me. I couldn’t imagine what it was like before. Today, he’s thriving and learning, in the process of getting his refugee status paperwork (which you can only get after 16 hence the delay), with plans to go to university, and the hope of changing his life so he can support his grandmother the way she so selflessly supported him. On top of this, he’s insanely talented - he’s the captain of the football team, a dancer, and a runner. Who knows where his future could take him with a little help. @unicef @unicefethiopia #childrenuprooted #achildisachild

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Reminiscing and counting our blessing with my mama @atajohnson 🙏🏾🥃🥃

Raising a post Thanksgiving @teremana toast to gratitude and how one fateful Thanksgiving back in 1987 had a profound impact on our lives.

‘87 was a rough one for us.
Got our asses kicked pretty good.
Got evicted off the island of Hawaii.
Forced to move to Nashville.
8 weeks later, things went to shit in Nashville and we were forced to finally move to Bethlehem, PA.

That Thanksgiving in Bethlehem, we were so broke we couldn’t afford a Thanksgiving dinner.

Then we got the call from new friends we had met asking if we had any plans and would we like to come over?

HELL YEAH what’s your address??😂😂🙏🏾

They asked my mom to say the Thanksgiving prayer — of course she only got thru the first line and then bursts out in tears 😭.

Clearly she still can’t get thru the story without crying 🤣.

Thanksgiving will always represent something special to me and my family.

I’m sure a lot of you guys have gone thru this too and some of you might still be going thru it - hold your heads up and have faith that things’ll get better.
We’ve been there.

Happy Holidays, my friends and I’m slowly teaching my mom the tequila technique of “don’t shoot it, SIP IT” 😂🤦🏽‍♂️

I’ve watched him grow from a talented young artist who slowly and respectfully worked his way up through the years in the the old fashioned way, never expecting short cuts and always putting his work and others first. He values hard work and is loyal to the core. Never one to follow trends, he’s become a trailblazer, pioneer, educator and an inspiration to artists around the world. I’m so excited I can finally announce our 2nd collaboration together. I’ve watched him work passionately for the past year on this collection and campaign (and he’s also driven us all crazy!) in his quest for perfection.

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"Fashion is such an important part of global culture, often arising from centuries of tradition, and doesn’t go out of style when the seasons change. The ‘Saree’ is one of the most iconic and recognized silhouettes from India. To me, its beauty lies in its versatility, not just in drape and fabric. It embodies elegance, femininity, and power, and I love how I feel when I’m wearing one.

I’m so proud to be wearing a @Taruntahiliani saree on @instylemagazine’s July cover! Thank you @laurabrown99 for being such an amazing creative partner, and for sharing some of India’s incredible fashion with the world. #IndianSummer #ProudDesi (Link to the story in bio)",7533,1473229,2019-06-05 12:22:02+00:00,Photo,2019,6,5,12,Wednesday,2019-06-05,44701002,115,3.3125924112394616

Cristiano Ronaldo,Athlete,2982,459,"Yesterday, with a poor performance and a result far from acceptable, we closed our scheduled games for 2020, a special year in many particular ways. Empty stadiums, COVID protocols, postponed games, long stoppages and a very tight calendar.

But this is no excuse for anything. We know that we have to give more of ourselves, in order to play better and to win in a more consistent way. We are Juventus! And we simply cannot accept anything less than excellence on the pitch!

I hope this short stoppage may help us to come back stronger and more united than ever, because the season is still far from over and in the end we believe that we will, once again, celebrate with our tiffosi.

Believe in us, trust our team as much as we trust you, and we will deliver!

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"THIS IS HAWKMAN 🦅
A pleasure to welcome @aldis_hodge to BLACK ADAM.
HAWKMAN is a critical leading role for our movie, as he is the fiery leader of the JSA (Justice Society of America) and one of the most beloved and legendary characters in the DC UNIVERSE.

I called Aldis personally as I wanted to surprise him that he got the role and it wound up being one of the greatest conversations I’ve ever had.

Aldis: Hello?

DJ: Hello, I’d like to speak to Aldis.

Aldis: Who is this?

DJ: This is Dwayne Johnson.

* long pause

Aldis: Whoever this is stop playing on my phone.

DJ: This is Dwayne, is this Aldis?

* longer pause

Aldis: This shit ain’t funny, I said stop playing on my fucking phone.

DJ: Aldis, this is DJ. I just called to say thank you so much for sending in your audition - it was great and I really appreciate the efforts you made. Just wanted to say thanks and best of luck in all you do. And one more thing — welcome to Black Adam.

* longest pause

Aldis: I’m sorry you’ll have to hold on for a one second.
* he puts the phone down and walks away and all I hear is inaudible yells 😂

Aldis: DJAYYYY OHHHHH SHIT!!!!!!

* Im laughing my ass off by now.

DJ: You ok? You’re gonna crush this role!

We went on to have an awesome conversation full of gratitude, love and motivation.

Can’t wait to work with this very talented brother.

The perfect HAWKMAN.

Let’s get to work.

Honestly, without you my life would be boring, not as full and my life would always feel as if something was missing. Today and every day, I pray that your soul is covered in love and from your core, I pray that you’re happy! You deserve only magical things!

Justin Timberlake,Musician,751,887,"First tournament I ever played in... He looked this young man in the eye and introduced himself. You could feel the GREATNESS surrounding him. I was in awe. A few months later, I ran into him on the driving range at Bay Hill with a pitching wedge in my hand and he sat and helped me with my swing (despite his best efforts, I still need all the help I can get...) He changed the game forever. He defined what the modern athlete is. He flew his own plane to his tournaments. He STARTED a network JUST for the sport. He won spectacularly. He lost graciously. He was bigger than the game. And, he was one of the nicest men I have ever met.

I liked the game of golf when I met him. And, HE made me love it. Mr. Palmer, you will be missed by so many avid fans but you will forever be the remembered as THE KING. The definition of a LEGEND.

R.I.P.

Love,

This is a hard-back, coffee-table style book that I hope serves as a keepsake to remember a time that the whole world has experienced together, and that everyone can find art that they relate to within its pages. 🧡⁣

I usually have a cool and calm demeanor when I hear good news, but admittedly when I heard this I said, “HOLY SHIT MY SONG WENT QUADRUPLE F*CKING PLATINUM??” 😂🤦🏽‍♂️🙏🏾

Thank you to my brother - the one and only iconic maestro, Lin Manuel Miranda for writing this classic for me to sing and the world to sing along to.

Thank you to all of you around the world 🌎 who love the song and the swaggy, fun it brings.

And finally, a huge daddy thank you to the real reason this song is 4Xs Platinum and growing - my 2 year old boss, Baby Tia who LOVES hearing me sing this song to her, but has no idea I’m actually, Maui - which kinda makes this whole thing that much more awesome. 💁🏽‍♂️☺️

And one last thing...

You’re welcome... and thank you 😉💪🏾

Mighty’s on the other side now. After 7 days of searching from sunrise to sunset and into the wee hours, today, the 7th day ~the number of completion~ we found his collar... I have wept more this week than I thought possible, which has been very cathartic and healing... I left no stone unturned, crawled thru all the man holes, under the roads, searched every back yard and creek bed. Had two separate sniffer dogs do their best as well. I feel so grateful to have learned from my little Mighty man that love is eternal and the true meaning of devotion. I feel sure he was looking down on me whistling in every back yard and knowing that I was doing all I possibly could to respect our bond. He was more than a companion. It was a soul connection for sure. I’m sorry. I love you. Thank you. RIP my MIGHTY HEART my little fellow A ♠️’s

❤️Thank you to the community for allowing me to search through their yards for him and supporting my midnight walks. It was reassuring to see the best of people even in the worst of times.

Despite an ongoing global pandemic, Azerbaijan has violated the UN’s appeal for global ceasefire by unprovoked attacks against the Republic of Armenia. Civilian structures in Armenia have been targeted, and Azerbaijan has now threatened to bomb the nuclear power plant in Armenia. In the meantime, congressional amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act will be voted on next week to ensure that the US does not enable Azerbaijan with military aid that would be used against Armenia and Artsakh. The international community needs to pay attention and intervene now with such political and diplomatic measures to prevent unnecessary escalation and the loss of human life.

I stand with my fellow Armenians and pray for those that are involved in recent tensions on the border of the country. I urge for a peaceful resolution for these unprovoked attacks during this already very difficult pandemic.

My beautiful friends... This is a matter of humanity!!! Of goodness and basic human kindness and decency!!! My heart is breaking. So many people are hurting right now.

How can anyone say they love this country and not do something when they see lives cut short because of the color of their skin?
We need to erase the fear and hatred that exists. Not erase people. We are all God’s children. We need to love and appreciate all the beautiful things that every individual person is. There are more of us who live a life of love and acceptance than those who live in rage and hate. Do not let the angry, and hateful win!! Say something. Do something. Let’s build bridges not burn them.
We have lost our way these past few years but we can find our way back. We need to speak up and speak love. Every chance we get... we need to storm the polls in November and VOTE... we need change!!!

I was stood one day in The Cliff training ground in the reception just about to go to Annie Kay’s house (my digs) and Neil Webb walks past me and out the door, then Eric walks down the stairs from his office and right up to me and says “You will replace him in the first team one day“ I smiled with excitement but I also thought that’s not gonna happen any time soon and then it did. The Cliff training ground brings back so many memories as does Littleton road of Eric, 2 laps warm up, 5 ball routine, 12 minute run and the damn heading game which as you can imagine I did not like, but it was all about preparing us for the first team and preparing to play for Sir Alex Ferguson & Manchester United. David stop playing those #*!¥*+€ Hollywood balls will forever be the words that stay in my head but then Eric has me kicking a ball against a wall 60 times with both feet from different distances and that became one of my biggest strengths. Ultimately it was The Boss that had that faith in us and took us to the next level but the person that prepared us and we wouldn’t have been the players and men we turned out to be was Eric...

⁠
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced in a Tuesday news conference that his office would not seek charges against Rusten Sheskey, the 31-year-old Kenosha police officer who has been on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice since the Aug. 23 shooting.⁠
⁠
Blake, who witnesses said had been trying to break up an argument between two women, was shot as he walked back toward his vehicle. In his written report, Graveley said Blake was armed with an open knife he was holding in his right hand.⁠",2022,112151,2021-01-06 00:29:52+00:00,Photo,2021,1,6,0,Wednesday,2021-01-06,96011884,140,0.11891548758693248

Some parts in Trinidad are ok but a large number of areas look like this and worse and people have lost everything they possess. People are now out in droves giving all the assistance they can to who needs it. In the disaster the blessing of togetherness stands so strong in this moment here in Trinidad and Tobago everyone is lending a hand even those who have nothing left. In accordance to the Office of Disaster and Preparedness Trinidad and Tobago is NOT under any Tropical storm or Hurricane watch, this is just a very weird weather system over T&T and the destruction you saw in pics and videos is from 3 days steady rain. The office reports that the orange weather alert stands until Tuesday 23rd Oct 2018 so we have to continue to brace as we seek to rebuild. There are a lot of people from abroad asking about assisting but they haven’t seen any info on how to do so, so we will gather what info we can and put it in a next post. Thanks for all the prayers and we journey through this time.",6599,392490,2018-10-22 04:45:33+00:00,Photo,2018,10,22,4,Monday,2018-10-22,90164407,193,0.4426236619068542

Ellen DeGeneres,Actor,9224,415,"Artist, organizer, educator, and popular public speaker, Patrisse Cullors is a Los Angeles native and Co-Founder of the @blklivesmatter Global Network and Founder of grassroots Los Angeles based organization @dignityandpowernow. Cullors’ work for Black Lives Matter recently received recognition in Time Magazine’s 2020 100 Women of the Year project. Cullors is a New York Times bestselling author of When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir (2018). She is also the Faculty Director at Arizona’s Prescott College of a new Social and Environmental Arts Practice MFA program that she has developed. In 2019, Patrisse joined Freeform’s Good Trouble Season two as a staff writer and actor. She has continued writing for its third season. For the last 20 years, Cullors has been on the frontlines of criminal justice reform and led @reformlajails ‘Yes on R” campaign, a ballot initiative that passed by a 71% landslide victory in March 2020. Patrisse’s work to decarcerate and affirm human dignity continues as she joins The Justice Collaborative team as a Senior Advisor.

I’m grateful to have the opportunity to participate in #sharethemicnow. So much of the work that I do is about lifting up the voices of Black women and people at the margins. I focus on issues of policing and mass incarceration and have dedicated the last 21 years of my life to supporting the freedom of Black people. Join me in imaging a new world, one that truly believes in supporting Black folks thriving not just surviving. 📸 @iamdamonturner",855,152925,2020-06-10 22:20:25+00:00,Photo,2020,6,10,22,Wednesday,2020-06-10,89980042,256,0.17090456570358126

For everyone in my comments saying “where’s d7” or wanting me to sing instead of speaking up about what needs to change in this country, THIS IS WHY I POST AS MUCH AS I DO. THIS IS WHY I CARE. THIS CANNOT HAPPEN ANY FUCKING MORE. I’m angry, embarrassed and ashamed.

I’m in the studio working on something special after today’s assault on democracy.

Kim Kardashian,TV Star,5373,117,"To our amazing fans -

It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We’ll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we’ve met along the way.

Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience and, most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who’ve spent countless hours documenting our lives.

Our last season will air early next year in 2021.

Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years. This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever.

With Love and Gratitude,

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426,389,"Past few days I’ve been stunned trying make sense of George Floyd’s death.
The video.
The plea for breath.
The callous response.
The racism.
The killing.
This is our ongoing disease.
I’ve had cops in my family.
Good men.
And there’s a cop code, granting you the authority to use force if your life is in danger.
But when a man is handcuffed, on the ground, no longer a threat, with your brothers in arms standing around watching and he struggles to say, “please I can’t breathe” when your knee is on his neck.. not his back, but his neck - cutting off his air.
Cop code must become moral code.
Ethics code.
HUMANITY code.
Knowing that if you don’t ease up, then that man is going to die.
So when you decide to not ease up, your intention is to kill.
And that’s what this was.
George Floyd, said “officer I can’t breathe” as he struggled for air.
He said these words a total of 15 times. Not once. Not twice.
15 times.
These officers will be charged, I’m positive of that.
Held accountable.
But then where’s the greater accountability?
The leadership to healing.
More importantly, the leadership to EQUALITY.
We ultimately win when we can normalize equality.
I’m so sorry to the Floyd family. My heart breaks for you.
Let the process begin now.

Shraddha Kapoor,Actor,1708,675,"#LockdownZoos

A lot of us are feeling anxious and “caged” during this lockdown. Imagine being taken away from your family, your home and being locked up for your entire life?
.
Animals have feelings just like us. They get depressed when separated from their natural habitats and loved ones. Why should we believe that we have the right to take away their freedom?
.
When @shazamorani asked me to be a part of this cause, I immediately jumped on board because I realized I could lend my voice to those who don’t have one. Animals can’t speak for them selves, we need to become their voice. I would truly hope that all of you do the same.✨💜 .

“Until one loves an animal, a part of ones soul remains unawakened.” - Anatole France.

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252,556,"So proud to present the first look of THE WHITE TIGER - directed, written, and produced by Ramin Bahrani, based on The New York Times Bestseller and the 2008 Man Booker Prize-winning novel.

This is a story about a family and the plight of one man - Balram Halwai played by Adarsh Gourav, one of the most talented newcomers I've ever worked with, and one of the most remarkable performances I’ve seen in a long time. Balram’s rise from a poor villager to successful entrepreneur in modern India showcases how hunger and the lack of opportunity can build and drive a human being’s animal instinct of survival.
Rajkumar Rao, already one of the most prolific actors in India, will showcase depths very few can.
The film is powerful. It will make you uncomfortable, and most importantly it will entertain you.

Coming soon to Netflix globally.

My friend @alokvmenon has a new book out called #BeyondTheGenderBinary that is a great resource to learn more about how to support trans and gender non-conforming people. They have launched a book drive to donate 5000 copies to LGBTQ youth all across the country for Pride. You can donate a copy and order one for yourself at the link in their bio. This will be a life saving resource for so many people and will change the way that you think about gender. We all deserve to live in a world that celebrates our creativity over our conformity!

LeBron James,Athlete,2117,366,"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.

To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.
 
There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.

Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. ""The arm of the Lord is not shortened,"" and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope- FREDERICK DOUGLASS 🙏🏾✊🏾💪🏾👑",27068,1402223,2020-07-04 21:32:27+00:00,Photo,2020,7,4,21,Saturday,2020-07-04,67559334,212,2.115608481279581
