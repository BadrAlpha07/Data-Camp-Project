The first step in making lasting change is understanding the best, most effective routes to achieve it. As Americans, we have the power to vote in—or vote out—the people who make decisions about how our streets are policed and how the criminal justice system operates. The policies put in place aren’t the result of random events, they are a reflection of the people we vote into office. So make sure you take the time to figure out who best represents you and your vision for the future. Then make sure your friends, family, and everyone in your neighborhood is figuring that out for themselves, too.⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣

Te has ido para siempre amigo.
Tus hijos, tu esposa Inés, tus nietos, tus amigos y yo, te recordaremos con un grande y profundo cariño por tu humildad y el fondo tierno de tu alma que bien conocíamos quienes te queríamos.
Has realizado tantas luchas, muchas de ellas inmerecidas y aquella por tu vida la has librado como siempre, con la dignidad y fortaleza que tanto admiraba.
Ahora descansa y vuela hacia un mejor lugar donde no hay traiciones, ni desilusiones, ves a buscar la tranquilidad y el refugio en tus padres, tu hermano y todos los que también te han amado y de verdad conocido.
Seré siempre tu amiga, a pesar de cualquier cosa, en el más allá, como en esta vida.
Te quiero amigo,

Like so many of us here in the US and around the world - getting back can be a tough decision that work requires real consideration and strategic planning around best health practices and safety measures.
I’m happy to announce our RED NOTICE production will resume shooting next month in mid September.
Thank you to our tremendous partners at NETFLIX who’ve joined us shoulder to shoulder to provide the safest and most aggressive “quarantined bubble” for our production crew as possible.
I’m confident in our safety strategy and execution, but we’ll also be fluid and amenable to best practice changes on the fly.
Stay healthy and stay disciplined, my friends as you all get back to work.
Good luck!
And to my RED NOTICE crew - the hardest workers in the room, mount up - because we’re going back to work.
See you on set.

This is a video of #BreonnaTaylor and her little sister just living their lives. Breonna is one of many Black people in America who have been senselessly killed by police officers. The officers who broke into her house while she was sleeping and shot her eight times, STILL have not been arrested. It’s unacceptable and it breaks my heart. 💔 ⠀

While we mourn with her family and the rest of the country, please #SayHerName... Make noise, make phone calls, and demand justice. ⠀

Selena Gomez,Musician,1692.0,153.0,"Please meet Kendrick Sampson (@kendrick38). He is an actor, activist and founder of the non-profit initiative BLD PWR. BLD PWR engages culture, education and activism to build and train an inclusive community of entertainers and athletes to advance radical social change. Partnering with grassroots causes and organizations, the purpose of BLD PWR is to increase action and civic engagement with a primary focus on uplifting and protecting the most vulnerable by undoing systemic oppression and combating state violence at the intersection of gender, immigration, economic, educational, environmental and racial justice movements. ⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀
Kendrick is best known for his role on HBO's comedy series ""Insecure,"" where his character Nathan grapples with mental health and lives with bipolar disorder. Kendrick uses his voice to empower marginalized communities and to shine light on issues of inequity. His activism is focused on racial justice, specifically intersectionality within criminal justice reform and uniting the oppressed Black, Brown & Indigenous communities. He is social justice leader, an abolitionist and stood on the front lines at Standing Rock and efforts of Black Lives Matter in LA and beyond. Kendrick is taking over my Instagram today!⠀

Said I’m the nicest guy you’ll ever meet, but when it comes to competition - I don’t give a fuck who’s in front of me - they’re not gonna stop me.

And can’t wait to see who plays angry tonight - you can feel it in the air.

Good luck, brothers.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"This old video I posted last year in 2019 about a special phone call I had with my dad has a surreal sense of catharsis to it.
A few weeks after I posted this, my dad found his dream home.
3 months later he moved in.
8 months later he passed away.
Died suddenly and I never got a shot to say goodbye.
A real kick in the gut but I know I’m not alone, because it’s what we all signed up for in this unpredictable cycle of life.
This old post just reminded even more to be as grateful and appreciative as I can be with the ones I love.
Be present and squeeze every bit of juice out of life that we can, because we never know when our journey comes to an end.
Live full, my friends.

12 years to #Fashion 🤩

It was 2008. I was just about 5 years into my acting career and had already seen extreme highs and extreme lows in it. I was told taking on this movie could be a risk. But working with the brilliant Madhur Bhandarkar and his incredible team of writers, Ajay Monga, Niranjan Iyengar and Anuraadha Tewari, for almost 6 months before we even started the movie, was one of the most collaborative experiences of my life.

Then on set, bringing life into all the various shades of my character Meghna Mathur, was one of my first truly immersive acting jobs. Thank you to the incredible cast that made everything I did much better. Thank you to the amazing technicians and crew, who through all the craziness, always brought it home.

And most importantly, thank you to the audience who went to theatres to watch what was then billed as a ‘female-centric’ movie and made it a huge success which in turn helped showcase that women could hold their own at the box office. #Jalwa

Thank you all for remembering this piece of work with such fondness. #20in2020

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"💫 One of the most memorable moments of TIME’S UP in the UK for me has been the launch of the Justice and Equality Fund (the UK’s version of the Legal Defence Fund), which aims to support women who have experienced harassment and abuse, improve accountability, and prevent future abuses from occurring. 💸 The JEF offers much-needed funds to existing expert services and to grassroots activism. 🌱 Many people don’t realise that very basic services which protect and care for women in the UK are under threat, and it’s incredible the difference the fund has made in a short space of time. 🌷
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Justice and Equality Fund (JEF) has already resourced the vital work of organisations like 💪🏾💗London Black Women's Project, who provide specialist support to women of colour and migrant survivors of abuse, and 👩🏻‍⚖️ Rights of Women, who will resource a free and confidential helpline led by women lawyers offering legal advice to women experiencing sexual harassment. ☎️❤️ The JEF has also supported keeping the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre for England and Wales helpline open and is resourcing the first rape crisis service provision in Northern Ireland in 12 years. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⭐️ I hope that more people will be inspired by the #TIMESUP anniversary to give at home here in the UK, so the Justice and Equality Fund can reach even more under-resourced organisations and campaign groups in 2019.

Some parts in Trinidad are ok but a large number of areas look like this and worse and people have lost everything they possess. People are now out in droves giving all the assistance they can to who needs it. In the disaster the blessing of togetherness stands so strong in this moment here in Trinidad and Tobago everyone is lending a hand even those who have nothing left. In accordance to the Office of Disaster and Preparedness Trinidad and Tobago is NOT under any Tropical storm or Hurricane watch, this is just a very weird weather system over T&T and the destruction you saw in pics and videos is from 3 days steady rain. The office reports that the orange weather alert stands until Tuesday 23rd Oct 2018 so we have to continue to brace as we seek to rebuild. There are a lot of people from abroad asking about assisting but they haven’t seen any info on how to do so, so we will gather what info we can and put it in a next post. Thanks for all the prayers and we journey through this time.",6599.0,392490.0,2018-10-22 04:45:33+00:00,Photo,2018.0,10.0,22.0,4.0,Monday,2018-10-22,90164407.0,193.0,

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Seeing this image of actor, @officialjosephleeanderson playing my dad, Rocky Johnson (RIP Soulman) really sat me down💔😢

On set of our new @nbc TV series, YOUNG ROCK - a show that explores my insanely wild childhood and all the many lessons life has thrown at me and my family along the way.

My dad suddenly passed away earlier this year.
Never had a chance to say goodbye to my old man, which really sucks - but as he always said, “hey the show must go on”.

And so it will.

Hope you’re proud of this one Soulman... who would’ve ever thought huh!? 🥃

Wanted you guys to see this “first look” at my pops.
No filters, no polish and nothing fancy. Just the Soulman doing what he did best!

Can’t wait for you guys to watch our new show. I think you’re gonna like it.

#SummerFrenzy - OUT NOW 🕶☀️🌴
.
Finally, after months of anticipation, DJ Frenzy is back with the tune of the Summer!
.
Blending Summer reggae vibes with classic Punjabi Folk, ‘Summer Frenzy’ brings forward Gurdas Maan in a way that you’ve never heard him before.
.
DJ Frenzy is known for his unique take on Bhangra mash-ups and has gained worldwide acclaim. Having performed at the Delhi & Mumbai wedding receptions of Virat Kohli & Anushka Sharma in 2017, he was requested earlier this year by Virat to create this mix.
.
“Virat asked me to make a mix for Sajna Ve Sajna, but to be honest, this is one song that I've been avoiding mixing - when the original is perfect, there's a high chance of ruining it when doing a mix. I wanted to do something big for this one, something different. Hopefully my mix does justice to the original.”",2014.0,1841724.0,2018-08-06 09:52:32+00:00,Video,2018.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,Monday,2018-08-06,18850588.0,152.0,

Truly a new approach to the super hero genre... to play a character the evokes both fear and empathy... the Soldiers journey. JUST WOW! The cast was brilliant, the crew will be proud for the rest of their lives... and no one will EVER imagine that Dave Wilson was a FIRST time Director. I am speechless.

So excited (and proud) to drop @laurenhashianofficial’s Official Music Video for, “STEP INTO A LOVE LIKE THIS” tomorrow 🙏🏾💫

We asked you around the world 🌎 to send us your wedding videos because we wanted YOUR VIDEOS to make up the official music video for the song.

Lauren wrote and sang the song for me as my wedding gift and it’s truly our pleasure to share our love and mana - with all of you sharing your love and mana with us as well.

Be prepared for lots of tears 😭 of joy when you watch it — beautiful love from all different couples from around the world ❤️🖤🤎🤍💙💚💛

Video drops TOMORROW (Friday)!

Threw around my 50lb chains ⛓ for a drop set - I got lumped up and need stitches 😂🧵

Taste your blood, keep training and stitch up later - rules of the house.

And I can confirm my blood tastes like Teremana, calluses and BlaMoan (black and samoan) Hot Sauce🩸🤣😈💪🏾

Have a productive week, my friends - keep it light and a lil’ fun, but get after it like a MF.

To P and Chad: you changed my life and will always be two of my heroes. And you are still doing it at that level.

It’s a good day when my friend and A cam 🎥 operator, Geoff Haley makes me belly laugh - no doubt from his filthy, inappropriate jokes my innocent ears should not be hearing.
Over the years, the biggest movies of my career have been shot by Geoff, who was just awarded “Operator of the Year” (equivalent to winning an Academy Award) for his brilliant camera work on JOKER.
He’s a phenomenal storyteller behind the lens and this summer we’re pumped to collaborate again on our highly anticipated, BLACK ADAM⚡️
DC Universe, we’re excited to come play.
Until then, it’s back to work on this one.

Cricket has given me many incredible memories - and, among the most precious, stands the partnership with @virat.kohli , playing for RCB and against Gujarat Lions in 2016.

Everything clicked on what was a truly unforgettable night at the IPL. The capacity crowd at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium were going crazy, and we both scored centuries in a partnership of 229 runs from 96 balls. More importantly, RCB won the match by 144 runs.

Now we find ourselves in a global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and Virat and I would like to help people in need, people struggling to put food on the table.

So we are donating some of the key items from that special day in 2016 - Virat’s bat and gloves, my shirt and bat - and creating one unique auction item, on the Bid or Buy online platform(link in my bio-type key words in the search button to find the piece). All money raised will be donated to charities supporting people most severely affected by the crisis, split 50/50 between charities working in SA and India.

Immediately after the auction closes on 10 May, 2020, I will personally contact the winner and make arrangements for the package to be delivered to your home.

Take care and stay safe.",11516.0,2490665.0,2020-04-27 08:14:17+00:00,Photo,2020.0,4.0,27.0,8.0,Monday,2020-04-27,56882531.0,243.0,

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Happy Birthday SoulMan 💪🏾💫🖤

It’s my dad’s first birthday since he passed away earlier this year on January 15th.
I miss him.
Think about him often.
Think about all the lessons he left me with.
Some good.
Some great.
Some not so much.
And even some brand new lessons I only came to realize after he passed away.

Considering he paved the road for me and countless other men and women of color in sports and entertainment — he was so proud when I become the first ever Black/Samoan heavyweight champion of the @WWE.
He used to love telling people — I taught Dwayne everything he knows...BUT I didn’t teach him everything I KNOW 😂👊🏾

Sometimes when people like my dad, “pave the road” and trail-blaze, they often pay an emotional & physical price.
My dad would always say - people can’t feel your pain, they can only see it — so why show them?.
But there’s some shots in this video where I can see the burden in his eyes and the pressures taking their toll.

Which motivates me even more to continue putting in the hard work with my own two hands and utilizing those life lessons my old man taught me.
The good lessons.
The good stuff.

Happy Birthday SoulMan.
I love and miss you, dad.
And I’ll see you down the road.

** and we all see great physiques all over Instagram these days, but in the 70’s/80’s — holy shit my dad was jacked and had an incredible and RARE combo of DENSE MUSCLE & AGILITY.
What a goat 🐐
I gotta get to the gym 😂💪🏾

Katy Perry,Musician,1706.0,635.0,"I don’t know when a soul enters a new vehicle but if there is an afterlife where there’s a waiting room of the coming and going my mind wonders if the soul that is waiting to come into my world is getting a kiss on the forehead from my sweet Grandma that departed this earth yesterday. My heart hopes so.
If she is able to speak with the soul in waiting the conversation would probably include “are you sure you wanna pick this wild group?!” There would most definitely be some sarcasm, a witty quip or two... tbh grandma probably had a glass of her favorite blush wine ready upon arrival to this afterlife... and a most fashionable look, jewels included, naturally.
A lot of what I am is because of my father... and he is because of her. She started it all, as she used to remind us and I’m so grateful she did.

Family... is there to show us what love can be... sometimes that journey of finding the love is tough to get to AND through but if you can open your heart and let the light lead the way you will find that incomparable love.
Ann Pearl Hudson was a fighter. She survived the Great Depression, raised 3 kids on her own as a seamstress, making G strings for showgirls and other such characters in Vegas. She was always authentically herself, funny and full of all the sweet cozy things you think of when you think of grandmas. She gave me crisp dollar bills in hallmark cards, she let us eat her favorite almond cookies from the 99 cent store while we asked questions about the different fans she had displayed on her walls. She was a wonderful grandma and I will forever carry some of her in me.
When my whit comes out, that’s Ann.
When my authenticity comes out, that’s Ann.
When my stubbornness comes out, hell, that’s Ann.
When my fighter spirit comes out, that’s Ann.
When my style comes out, that’s Ann.
May she rest in deep peace and kiss the forehead of the soul to come and let them know everything is gonna be OK, especially now that they have gained an angel to look over them ♥️♠️",34318.0,2602741.0,2020-03-09 11:40:02+00:00,Photo,2020.0,3.0,9.0,11.0,Monday,2020-03-09,92741853.0,384.0,

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the gender equality youth activists (Elizabeth, Mervis, Patricia and Tamara) I met with back in Lilongwe, Malawi. We discussed the issues girls face in Malawi and how organisations like @CAMFED, @UNWOMEN and the Malawi Girl Guides Association are helping them overcome these challenges. There is lots of work to be done, and more resources are desperately needed, but I’m hopeful for the future after seeing the enthusiasm these young women have for change. I know they will be holding President Mutharika to his commitment to end child marriage in Malawi within five years! #goal5

My jacket and trousers are from @edun. The sustainable organic cotton canvas material is sourced from a mill in South Africa. The material is untreated which avoids any harmful chemical treatments or finishing processes, which is much better for the environment.

Shoes were by @ancientgreeksandals. They are handmade locally by skilled craftsmen in Greece using traditional techniques that have existed for centuries. The chemical free, natural tan leather ages beautifully with time and wear. Perfect for #30wears!

I’m rewearing recycled jewellery from @allbluesofficial #30wears

Virat Kohli,Athlete,1109.0,198.0,"Two weeks ago, we started work on India’s biggest concert. To entertain people who are locked-down at home. To pay tribute to those who work on the frontlines while we work from home. And to raise funds for those who have no work and no home. And when we were just days away from the concert, we lost two of our leading lights: #IrrfanKhan and #RishiKapoor. A stark reminder that life is fleeting. We must play our part. And keep the show going. So with a prayer in our hearts and a song on our lips, we bring you #IFORINDIA the concert for our times. 3rd May, 7:30pm IST. Watch it LIVE worldwide on Facebook. 100% of proceeds go to the India COVID Response Fund set up by @give_india

I’ve been a lucky SOB to have done some pretty cool shit in my career, but after seeing my @nbcyoungrock FANNY PACK FLOAT in the #MacysThanksgivingParade, this might take the cake.

This time in my life may represent when I had just $7bucks in my fanny pack, but at least I had enough COOL to tuck my turtleneck in and wear fake silver jewelry because it was all I could afford 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️

And my massive plucked raised eyebrow is the stuff that dreams (and nightmares) are made of
😂💀

Float on, kid.. you might just make it one day.

Really saddened to wake up to this news yesterday— the passing of my friend, Joe Laurinaitis (on the left) aka ROAD WARRIOR ANIMAL.
Joe & Mike aka HAWK & ANIMAL, THE ROAD WARRIORS were the most intense, legit tough bad asses tag team in the history of the wild world of pro wrestling.
When I was making my bones, still learning the business in the WWE as a very young “The Rock” - I wrestled these guys so many times on the road and they always took good care of me and made sure I learned.
Tough as nails.
Good men.
Greatest tag team of all time.
And apple fritters (our inside joke).
Much love and I’ll always be grateful to you both.
RIP.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Great questions 🌎👊🏾

How tall am I?
How much do I weigh?
And was I nervous when I first broke into Hollywood?
6’12. Kidding 6’4.
277lbs.
And hell yes, I was nervous.
In life, there are no guarantees and just because I was a popular pro wrestler - that meant nothing when it came to becoming a viable global box office draw.
I made the tough decisions and the most important of all, was deciding I was done trying to be someone I’m not to conform to Hollywood.
Instead, I decided to be my own man and Hollywood would eventually conform to me.
And remember, just because something doesn’t exist doesn’t mean it can’t happen ~ it just means you haven’t created it yet.
Thank you all for your questions.
Keep ‘em coming.
Stay healthy, disciplined and take care of one another.
We’ll get thru this together and eventually, we’ll rise again.

Cool update to share on my inspiring friend and Pompano Beach High School Senior Class President and Valedictorian, Lorraine Angelakos. A few months back, I surprised @lorraine.ang with a commencement address after she wrote me a heartfelt invitation asking for me to speak to her graduating class. In that letter, she included $7 BUCKS as a down payment because she knows what that number means to me.

That beautiful gesture moved me.

As promised, I held onto that $7bucks and made a special investment.

Lorraine, as you prepare to begin college this month - I wanted to let you know that my partners at @acorns have set you up with your very own account so that we can invest that $7 bucks you gave me towards your future.
And an additional $7BUCKS will be deposited into your account, EVERY WEEK for your entire four year college education!

Congrats Lorraine on all you’ve accomplished - I’m proud of you and your generation - Brown University is getting one heck of a leader and more importantly, one heck of a human being.

As we head into Labor Day Weekend, I wanted to remind all of you that there’s only a few days left to register your family and receive $7 bucks invested into your ACORNS EARLY ACCOUNT Don’t just save for your child’s future, invest in it.

It begins with $7 Bucks.

A @vanessakingori thread.

One of my favourite things about working at @BritishVogue is access to the beauty cupboard and the legendary beauty shoots we create.
I am a self confessed beauty junkie. I have chests and cupboards filled with products neatly (and some not so neatly) organised like objects of art and significance.
As I’ve increasingly shifted to clean beauty products, particular trends in the products targeted at Black communities have become a cause for concern.
Happily there are actions we can ALL take that protect Black health and the environment for all.

He nodded and said, “No sir, but we do”

I gave him a 👊🏾 and said “That guy was one of my heroes - you’re a good man”.

This is @ryan_adam_george_ and he’s a hard working PA with a great personality - representing our awesome PA department.

Kim Kardashian,TV Star,5373.0,117.0,"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is. For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn’t where we would be eating. I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home. All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It’s where each Kardashian child was born and made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper and kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings, decor out of the same fabric and print as the wallpaper. We had lunch at the home as if it hadn’t changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned. I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked. I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks! This was the most special, nostalgic day of my life and we felt my dad’s presence enjoying this day with us!
I kept it together and didn’t cry the entire lunch even though I cried during the entire planning process. But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door and cried so hard.",33549.0,4177691.0,2019-11-06 00:56:35+00:00,Photo,2019.0,11.0,6.0,0.0,Wednesday,2019-11-06,150840492.0,337.0,

I feel great and bullish about this date as it gives us time for Disney to be fully operational in all their businesses - theme parks, hotels, cruise ships, but more importantly, it gives the world time to bounce back to living confidently, productively and joyously once again.
Thank you, Disney leadership team.
And thank you to all the fans worldwide.
The movie will be worth the wait.
Stay healthy, my friends.

The lungs of the Earth are in flames. 🔥 The Brazilian Amazon—home to 1 million Indigenous people and 3 million species—has been burning for more than two weeks straight. There have been 74,000 fires in the Brazilian Amazon since the beginning of this year—a staggering 84% increase over the same period last year (National Institute for Space Research, Brazil). Scientists and conservationists attribute the accelerating deforestation to President Jair Bolsonaro, who issued an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land after taking office in January.⁣
⁣
The largest rainforest in the world is a critical piece of the global climate solution. Without the Amazon, we cannot keep the Earth’s warming in check. ⁣
⁣
The Amazon needs more than our prayers. So what can YOU do?⁣
⁣
✔ As an emergency response, donate to frontline Amazon groups working to defend the forest. ⁣
✔ Consider becoming a regular supporter of the Rainforest Alliance’s community forestry initiatives across the world’s most vulnerable tropical forests, including the Amazon; this approach is by far the most effective defense against deforestation and natural forest fires, but it requires deep, long-term collaboration between the communities and the public and private sectors. Link in bio.⁣
✔ Stay on top of this story and keep sharing posts, tagging news agencies and influencers. ⁣
✔ Be a conscious consumer, taking care to support companies committed to responsible supply chains.⁣ Eliminate or reduce consumption of beef; cattle ranching is one of the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation.
✔ When election time comes, VOTE for leaders who understand the urgency of our climate crisis and are willing to take bold action—including strong governance and forward-thinking policy.⁣

Taylor Swift,Musician,489.0,0.0,"I’m elated to tell you that my 9th studio album, and folklore’s sister record, will be out tonight at midnight eastern. It’s called evermore. To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them. And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, WB, and Justin Vernon. We’ve also welcomed some new (and longtime) friends to our musical kitchen table this time around...

With my favourite @thebodyshopindia , I am happy to announce the launch of Project NARI in partnership with @plasticsforchange . This initiative directly supports Nutrition Ability Retraining Inclusion for our female wastepickers-India’s invisible warriors in Covid19. With this project, we are providing them and their families with PPE kits, daily meals, nutrition supplements, job training towards becoming plastic quality engineers and direct cash transfers. Each time you donate Rs. 20/-or more, The Body Shop will match your donation.

I just did my bit, please join me and let’s make this a kind Diwali for those who keep our homes and streets safe.

Selena Gomez,Musician,1692.0,153.0,"Takeover by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi (@ibramxk)

We’ve heard many Americans—police officers, politicians, family members, perhaps you yourself—say that they are “not racist.” What’s the problem with being “not racist”? It is a claim that signifies neutrality: “I am not a racist, but neither am I aggressively against racism.” But there is no neutrality in the racism struggle. The opposite of “racist” isn’t “not racist.” It is “antiracist.” ⠀
⠀
What’s the difference between a racist and an antiracist? A racist believes in the idea of a racial hierarchy; an antiracist views the racial groups as equal. A racist believes problems are rooted in groups of people; an antiracist locates the roots of problems in power and policies. Denial is the heartbeat of racism; confession is the heartbeat of antiracism. ⠀
⠀
In order to be an antiracist, we must stop denying we have racist ideas, that we’re in some ways supporting racist policies, that we are being at times racist. We must acknowledge our own racism in order to start on our antiracist journey.⠀
⠀
I hope the resources I am sharing in stories today help you on your own daily, lifelong journey to strive to be an antiracist. ⠀
⠀

This was one special athlete, husband, father and friend. Having to write these words is hard enough but also knowing we have lost an amazing human being and his beautiful and talented daughter Gianna is heartbreaking. The commitment Kobe showed to his sport was inspiring, to go through the pain and to finish a game off like only he could inspired me to try to be better. Sometimes I would only go to games just to watch that clock go down to the last 2:00 minutes knowing that we were about to witness something special. Kobe always talked about Vanessa and his beautiful girls and how proud he was of them. Kobe’s passion was his family and basketball. He was determined to inspire the next generation of boys and girls to embrace the sport that he loved. His legacy will live on. My family’s love and prayers go out to Vanessa and the girls, to Kobe’s basketball family, and of course to the families of those who were tragically lost with him yesterday... 💛💜",15204.0,3520846.0,2020-01-27 12:46:15+00:00,Photo,2020.0,1.0,27.0,12.0,Monday,2020-01-27,61898000.0,209.0,

While it was definitely a personal achievement for me, what made it so special was seeing the joy and pride it gave my family.

With our military background, I can't even explain what a honour of this stature meant to me and my family. My Nani (grandmother), Bade Papa (eldest uncle), my mom, brother and my masis and mami (aunts) joined me that day and they were beyond thrilled to be at the iconic Rashtrapati Bhavan (the residence of the President) for the ceremony. Bade Papa came in uniform and looking at him as he stood beaming with pride, I truly understood what a moment it was for all of us. The only thing missing was my dad... even though he wasn’t physically there, I carried him with me. He was and is a big part of my journey ❤️🙏...

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"🌻✨✌🏻 So honoured to be working alongside Nobel Peace Laureates @nadia_murad_taha, @drdenismukwege @ouidedbouchamaoui, and other 🧠 thought leaders, 🌈 creatives and 🌱💪🏻 campaigners such as @AranyaJohar Assia Benziane @missaissa as part of the Gender Equality Council advising the G7 this year during the French Presidency. 💐 It's a source of sadness to us all that Nasrin Sotoudeh can only participate in absentia. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻💞 Together we’ll be continuing the work of the first Council convened last year in Canada and will be pushing G7 states and others to do more to make gender equality a reality at home and abroad. ⏰ At a time when many might feel a loss of confidence in politicians and the state, it's easy to forget how vital 🗳 national governments and👩🏼‍⚖️ legislation are in the ⚙️ wheel of factors that create meaningful and lasting change.♟📰 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
❤️🚨 Disengaging is quite simply not an option when in many parts of the world, we're seeing roll-backs 🕰🔙 on women and girls' rights and 🚫💰 cutbacks and corrosions to the basic state services that guarantee these rights. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🙋🏼‍♀️ As a Council, we’ll be recommending ways that states can improve their laws 🔎📜✍🏻 to strengthen women’s rights and will be encouraging them to make new commitments to ensure accountability and access to justice. 🗣⚖️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🏃🏼‍♀️💨 The clock is ticking though and we have a lot of work to do before the G7 meets in the summer, ⏳☀️ but I'm excited to work alongside so many experts I admire, and to learn from my Council colleagues and the civil society groups that come together as W7. ✊🏻💛
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As one of the youngest members of the group, 🍃🌸 I hope to bring the perspective of different generations to the table, as well as ensuring that the voices of the many activists, campaigners, women's organisations and movements that I've spent the past years working with and👂🏻💓 listening to, reverberate through the Council's work. 🎶🌼

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Keep your great questions coming 👊🏾

What are my favorite lifts in the gym?
And why am I always talking in the gym and not posting my workouts?
My favorite lifts are all of ‘em - full body - and always focusing on my lower body - my foundation - quads, glutes, hamstrings and calves.
Don’t skip leg day, men.
And I recommend taking written inventory on your training/fitness goals so when you’re back up and training full capacity you have a clear vision of your goals and pathway to accomplish them.
And I don’t post my workouts, because I’m sensitive to millions of you around the world who aren’t able to train in your local gyms and you’re stuck at home.
I’d feel like an asshole and it ain’t my style.
Just know I’m working extremely hard and I want all of you to get back to working out ASAP too.
Thanks for your great questions and keep ‘em coming.
Stay healthy, my friends.

Justin Timberlake,Musician,751.0,887.0,"Boys grow up to be fathers. I think about that a lot these days. We try to teach our son to love and to respect everyone — we teach him that all people are all created equal, and that no one should be treated differently because of the color of their skin. We teach him this because one day, he will go on to teach his kids the same. It’s a cycle. And right now, as we all work to undo generations of discrimination that have plagued our system and our communities across this country... I’m reminded today that the first lessons start at home. Im grateful for both of my dads and my mother for teaching me those lessons from the beginning. And for listening to me when I had something to say that they hadn’t learned. I pray for that humility with my own son. I’m grateful for my wife, who made me a father, and is my favorite person/partner/teacher/friend in all of it. I’m grateful for my son, who is always ALWAYS teaching me right back. ⠀
⠀
Happy Father’s Day to all the Dads out there. While we owe our sons and daughters these lessons in the places where the doors close at night, I hope you are as inspired as I am to make them THE TRUTH in the places that same door opens every morning and we send them out to discover. There’s more to do. And we are built for it. After all, we are the Dads.

Big mahalo to writer, Polina Marinova for writing this profile. Thanks for taking the time as this was a nice surprise to read.

True story - while I was “serving my time” on my two week school suspension - I heard a quote that would actually help shape the rest of my life, perspective and work ethic —

It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice.

A family friend had this made for me.

A paper weight to keep on my desk of me and my dad at the gym. I was too young to hit the weights back then, but after his workouts he’d always take me on the wrestling mats and beat my little ass. Those days were important.

My old man died suddenly, earlier this year. I never had a chance to say goodbye. Fucking 2020 huh?!

Still a beautiful gift, I’ll cherish.

Our country is crippled and on its knees, begging to be heard and pleading for change.
Where is our compassionate leader?
The leader who unifies and inspires our country at our most painful time when we need it the most.
The leader who steps up and takes full accountability for our country and embraces every color in it.
The leader who picks our country up off its knees and says you have my word - we got this - and together, change will happen.
Where are you?
Because we’re all here.
Maybe one day that galvanizing leader will emerge.
Either way, the process to change has already begun.

The damage and devastation the residents are facing after #HurricaneDorian is unfathomable so we’re matching dollar for dollar the the next $6 million raised. If you give $1 we’ll match it so we can hopefully turn that $6 million into $12 million, together.

The Bahamas is a really special place to me. I’ve spent a lot of time there over the years, both with my family and in the studio so I want to do all I can to help and I hope you will too.

If we do not do our job right now & do what we can to have a law put in place to help us feel protected in these streets then this type of crime will continue to happen without a worry in the world. A law needs to be put in place that will make these officers accountable as well as the other officers who are present at the scene of the crime. This needs to happen....This shouldn’t even be a discussion it should be an immediate ACTION!!!!! We need all of you governors & mayors to step up and do the right thing. I don’t know how to go about this but I promise you that I will try my best to figure it out.....ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We deserve the right to feel safe. A law like this will give us a level of comfort. Consequences to such ridiculous acts should be immediate and known by all. 20yrs in prison or life in prison....it has to be something....the other officers present that don’t stop or prevent these acts should get time as well....SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM NOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!

I always looked forward to seeing him on set, wondering what captivating interaction we would have next! Apart from being a wonderful co-actor who put his heart and soul in to his work, he was at his core, an amazing person. He cared for people and wanted to see them happy. His kind smile, the conversations we had at shoot about the Cosmos, different philosophies, the moments we spent together, were filled with magical wonderment! During a lovely musical and poetry filled get together at his home (he loved music and poetry), he showed me the moon from his telescope and I was so speechless that I could see it’s exquisite beauty up close!! He wanted to share that feeling! Our Chhichhore gang went to his beautiful home in Pavna, where we were awestruck together with the peace and calm of the nature around us - he loved nature! He saw things through a kaleidoscopic lens and wanted to share that with everyone around him. He was mesmerized by the simplest things and would muse on them in a genius way...! He was truly, One of a kind... I’ll miss you.. dearest Sush..

How many more lives do we have to lose? Surely this has to be the tipping point when we ALL face up to the police brutality that has been captured on video for everyone to see. Surely this is when we say STOP, we will not tolerate any more generations of black Americans and people of color growing up in fear of those who should protect them.

When an unarmed and handcuffed man is murdered by the police in broad daylight while begging for his life, those in authority need to know that our outrage knows no bounds. We demand justice.

There are many ways to make your voice heard. Sign the petition, get on the phone, talk to your family, friends and kids. If you are a business owner, make a public statement of support to your black clients, friends and co-workers. We can be the change. We have to start the conversation in our own circles.

This is sickening. It’s got to stop.

A huge club such as Juventus must always think like the best in the world, work like the best in the world, so that we can call ourselves one of the best and biggest clubs in the world.
Winning the Serie A once again in such a difficult year is something that we are very proud of. Personally, scoring 37 goals for Juventus and 11 for the Portuguese National Team is something that makes me face the future with renewed ambition and desire to keep doing better and better each year. But the fans demand more from us. They expect more from us. And we have to deliver, we must live up to the highest expectations.
May this short vacation break allow us all to make the best decisions for the future and come back stronger and more committed than ever.

“cw: homophobic/racist threats

An urgent request! I have already started to receive dozens of these. Just a reminder that 70 million + people voted for trump and many of them are extremely angry right now. After every win there is substantial backlash (in person as well as digital attacks) especially against visible minorities (trans women & femmes / Muslim women in hijabs / Black people / disabled people, etc).

While there is certainly cause for celebration, don’t lose vigilance and make sure that everyone is safe! There is heightened risk of hate violence right now!

This is @kingjaxsony Jaxson Patel.
He’s 13, lives in West Chapel, FL and has been battling scoliosis for half his life.

He just had a huge surgery where they placed two long rods in his back and had to cut him open from the top of his back all the way down to his lower back.

His amazing mama, Shannon wrote us the most beautiful letter - asking if I could just send her boy some encouragement as he truly is one of my biggest fans and finds inspiration in the things I do.

I filmed this personal message and here’s the result.

I always say it, because it’s true - stuff like this will always be the best part of my fame.

Stay strong, Jaxson and remember to be proud and embrace your cool, bad ass scar!

It’s the reminder of the warrior that you are.

Here’s what I’ve learned these past few weeks and maybe, you can find value in this take away and apply it to your own life.

Always speak your truth.

And when you do speak your truth - do your best to speak with dignity, compassion, respect, poise and empathy.

Even when the conversations get uncomfortable - when you approach with respect and care - on the other side of discomfort - is clarity and progress.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for giving me the space to speak my truth.

You have my word, I’ll always do my best to speak my truth with dignity, respect, empathy and GRATITUDE.

That’s my lesson I’ve learned.

And the result of speaking my truth is I was just informed, I’ve surged past and blown by 200 MILLION FOLLOWERS on Instagram and over 300 MILLION FOLLOWERS across all platforms - officially becoming/

The #1 followed man in America.

The #1 followed American man in the world.

And most importantly, the #1 daddy at home.

Love you guys, I always got your back and let’s keep rockin’ 🖤👊🏾

Selena Gomez,Musician,1692.0,153.0,"Alright. Speaking from my heart for over an hour to someone who puts those thoughts into paid words can be hard for me. The older I get the more I want my voice to be mine. This is all apart of my work within an industry that’s been around longer than all of us have been. The purpose of my interview was three fold. My work with A21, my new collection with Coach, and some new music. As I’m aware there will always be interests in one’s personal life because that’s the pace of our ‘social’ generation. I’m grateful for my position and I will always find ways to make my job more about others and giving back— all while having the best time with my music, fashion, film and my love for learning about the world that I’m eager to tap into more and more.
Church is a name for something far more personal. There’s always agenda seeking information on such a subject and I understand why. Rarely do I mention church (and I didn’t) but I’ll always feel comfortable talking about my values and beliefs. I respect that from everyone and anyone.
I understand that reporters are working to grab the attention of a reader, however I will always work to ensure that what is public represents my truth.
I’m a bit bummed but rarely surprised.
Y’all know me and my heart. I can’t help it. So I’ll post some of MY photos from the collection and work with A21. My heart. And maybe edit my actual lyrics as you will all hear it soon 😊
I love you guys to the moon and back. For more information on the work I do with A21 please, please visit link in my bio. So much more on that soon!",44833.0,5688705.0,2018-09-04 16:10:40+00:00,Photo,2018.0,9.0,4.0,16.0,Tuesday,2018-09-04,124444096.0,312.0,

I said it last night “ I play some songs for you ( the crowd) and some for me” but I think it’s important for my audience who maybe didn’t grow up listening to music with their parents , grandparents , older brothers / sisters to get exposed to some of these classics! No one should miss out on songs like these, the youth NEEDS to know what was before to understand how music got to where it is today !

Raising a post Thanksgiving @teremana toast to gratitude and how one fateful Thanksgiving back in 1987 had a profound impact on our lives.

‘87 was a rough one for us.
Got our asses kicked pretty good.
Got evicted off the island of Hawaii.
Forced to move to Nashville.
8 weeks later, things went to shit in Nashville and we were forced to finally move to Bethlehem, PA.

That Thanksgiving in Bethlehem, we were so broke we couldn’t afford a Thanksgiving dinner.

Then we got the call from new friends we had met asking if we had any plans and would we like to come over?

HELL YEAH what’s your address??😂😂🙏🏾

They asked my mom to say the Thanksgiving prayer — of course she only got thru the first line and then bursts out in tears 😭.

Clearly she still can’t get thru the story without crying 🤣.

Thanksgiving will always represent something special to me and my family.

I’m sure a lot of you guys have gone thru this too and some of you might still be going thru it - hold your heads up and have faith that things’ll get better.
We’ve been there.

Happy Holidays, my friends and I’m slowly teaching my mom the tequila technique of “don’t shoot it, SIP IT” 😂🤦🏽‍♂️

Rough phone calls to get this morning to tell me, our dear family member, Pat Patterson who was my pro wrestling mentor and father figure has passed away.

A @wwe hall of famer, TRUE trailblazer and one of the most brilliantly creative wrestling minds the industry has ever known.

He was also responsible for calling Vince McMahon when I was training to become a pro wrestler (my $7 bucks days) and said, “Vince you gotta see this kid work in the ring”.

Vince flew me to RAW a few weeks later and I had my first match EVER in Corpus Christie, Texas.

The rest is history and years later, here I am writing this post.

* cue Sinatra’s MY WAY (Pat’s favorite to sing)

...I’ve lived a life that’s full,
I traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way...

Love you, Pat.

And THANK YOU.

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"🌻✨✌🏻 So honoured to be working alongside Nobel Peace Laureates @nadia_murad_taha, @drdenismukwege @ouidedbouchamaoui, and other 🧠 thought leaders, 🌈 creatives and 🌱💪🏻 campaigners such as @AranyaJohar Assia Benziane @missaissa as part of the Gender Equality Council advising the G7 this year during the French Presidency. 💐 It's a source of sadness to us all that Nasrin Sotoudeh can only participate in absentia. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻💞 Together we’ll be continuing the work of the first Council convened last year in Canada and will be pushing G7 states and others to do more to make gender equality a reality at home and abroad. ⏰ At a time when many might feel a loss of confidence in politicians and the state, it's easy to forget how vital 🗳 national governments and👩🏼‍⚖️ legislation are in the ⚙️ wheel of factors that create meaningful and lasting change.♟📰 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
❤️🚨 Disengaging is quite simply not an option when in many parts of the world, we're seeing roll-backs 🕰🔙 on women and girls' rights and 🚫💰 cutbacks and corrosions to the basic state services that guarantee these rights. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🙋🏼‍♀️ As a Council, we’ll be recommending ways that states can improve their laws 🔎📜✍🏻 to strengthen women’s rights and will be encouraging them to make new commitments to ensure accountability and access to justice. 🗣⚖️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🏃🏼‍♀️💨 The clock is ticking though and we have a lot of work to do before the G7 meets in the summer, ⏳☀️ but I'm excited to work alongside so many experts I admire, and to learn from my Council colleagues and the civil society groups that come together as W7. ✊🏻💛
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As one of the youngest members of the group, 🍃🌸 I hope to bring the perspective of different generations to the table, as well as ensuring that the voices of the many activists, campaigners, women's organisations and movements that I've spent the past years working with and👂🏻💓 listening to, reverberate through the Council's work. 🎶🌼

You see it in the roles he plays. Like me he has never won an Oscar, but that means zero when it comes to how he has affected the world. His very existence represents the power of resilience. The love you have for him pales in comparison to the love I have for his spirit. On the weekend of the highest grossing movie of all times he in the most humble way says, your next brother. Fast 9 is going to take the industry to new heights! His belief in me sometimes scares me. I never want to let anyone down. So I will do everything in my power to make sure FAST 9 is everything! I love you RDJ and your brotherhood is truly a gift of which I am eternally grateful for.

Now it's time to pay back to the incredible people who make up the UK music industry including all the crew who work so hard behind the scenes. From the very start of my own career, playing live concerts up and down the country has been a cornerstone for my own career.  
I am proud to have had the chance to play through all the levels…small clubs, then theatres and ballrooms and into arenas, and of course festivals in between each touring cycle. But the possibility for other emerging British artists to take the same path is in danger and the livelihoods of those who work behind the scenes are at risk. The industry urgently needs Govt support in the interim period before all the various venues, festivals & promoters are ready and able to operate independently again. #LetTheMusicPlay",2934.0,916586.0,2020-07-02 13:31:49+00:00,Photo,2020.0,7.0,2.0,13.0,Thursday,2020-07-02,48226431.0,156.0,

BUCKET LIST: ✅
I’m not gonna lie — when I got the call that Ellen had read my coronavirus diary on cnn.com and was so moved by it that she wanted me on her show... I’m pretty sure I *hit the floor*. (Very uncool to admit this, but I’ve been a fan of hers for YEARS. I especially loved her monologue after being with Pres Bush at that football game. Ellen said: “When I say, 'be kind to one another,' I don't only mean the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.” 👏🏼) So when we taped this a few days ago, I had to keep it under wraps until the show aired today (see my segment, link in bio). But it was that same theme of kindness... YOUR kindness to me when I was sick... OUR kindness to one another during this unprecedented, horrific pandemic... that will GET. US. THROUGH. THIS. 👊🏼

I’m so honored to be part of today’s global effort to support the @armeniafund. I’ve been speaking out about the current situation in Armenia and Artsakh and having conversations with so many others to bring further awareness to the crisis that we cannot allow to advance.

My thoughts and prayers are with the brave men, women and children. I want everyone to remember that despite the distance that separates us, we are not limited by borders and we are one global Armenian nation together.

The @armeniafund is directly helping those that have been impacted during this critical time with humanitarian aid through food, shelter, and medical care.

I will be donating $1M to assist their efforts on the ground and invite you to join me. Whether you are helping with just raising awareness and posting on social media or donating just $1, every bit helps.

Let’s make this our most successful fundraiser ever.

Thank you so much. 🇦🇲 ❤️💙🧡",306631.0,19922588.0,2020-10-10 20:01:10+00:00,Video,2020.0,10.0,10.0,20.0,Saturday,2020-10-10,189853293.0,167.0,

We heard teachers were helping students bring home food when they didn't have enough.  When we saw this story, it brought tears not just to my eyes, but Alex's as well!  I don’t know if you guys know, but Alex and I are part owners in a company called Tiller & Hatch, and we decided to donate a years worth of of their yummy, healthy meals, for the students and their school’s food pantry. 🍽✨ This is why being a business owner, and having actual ownership in companies (not licensing), is so important to me and Alex, especially as Latinos. It's about showing our community, this is what life can be. You can take charge and take ownership. It allows us to have a say in creating things that make people's lives better and have partners that share our passion for giving back. Because giving back and being there for others is really what matters most ❤️❤️❤️ We are happy to be in business with partners who also believe no child should EVER have to go to sleep hungry.

Often times people get nervous, go silent, start laughing uncontrollably (which is always very funny:), won’t look me in the eyes, start stumbling on their words and some even start crying - like @kevinhart4real.
Then there are those few who look me right in the eyes, shake my hand and say, it’s nice to meet you too.
So I married her. 😉💍

When I read about the beautiful women who wake up consciously every day to make a change, it inspires me to want to do so much more. Not really sure how I got so lucky @time but thank you for highlighting the power of what we can and will always strive to be. I believe in the goodness in the land of the living.

I’ve always loved the deep green color of an emerald stone and how it symbolizes love, prosperity and healing.

Selena Gomez,Musician,1692.0,153.0,"Please meet Raquel Willis (@raquel_willis). Raquel is an activist, soon-to-be author, and media strategist dedicated to building the power of Black transgender people. She began her career as a newspaper journalist, and eventually began working with other Black trans organizers at Solutions Not Punishments Collaborative (@Snap4Freedom) to develop campaigns to support Black trans people being profiled by police in Atlanta. Her talents led her to Transgender Law Center (@translawcenter) where she founded Black Trans Circles (@blacktranscircles_tlc), a project focused on healing justice for Black trans women in the Southern and Midwestern United States. She is also the former executive editor of Out magazine, where she created The Trans Obituaries Project dedicated to elevating the stories of slain trans women of color. She is currently working on an essay collection about her life experiences and activism called The Risk It Takes to Bloom.⠀
⠀
Raquel believes in the power of storytelling and digital organizing as elements of radical change. She believes that the world can learn a great deal from Black transgender people because we are all limited by restrictive notions of gender. “Black trans people are a window of possibility for the men and boys who struggle to express their emotions and be tender, to the women and girls who struggle to be seen as smart and capable leaders, to everyone in between struggles within all simultaneously—you deserve to be complicated and human.”⠀

Every week, we read so many submissions and I am so inspired by the women who are going above and beyond in their communities to help others. This is the hope we need. A reminder that we are in this together and to lend a helping hand whenever possible. Today, we commemorate our final four women, and thank them for their courage and selfless acts. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

Dr. Michele is a pharmacist at a NY presbyterian hospital and works extra hours to train others. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

My words aren’t going to be poetic this time.
I’ve been willing to engage in thoughtful conversation for 4 years while trying to not offend those I love who loved this president...
I’ve tried with my words to explain how his rhetoric enables & encourages those who don’t like people that look like me.
I’ve tried with words.
Now I’m just grateful I’ve found a picture.
A picture from today.
This picture is the summation of everything I’ve been trying unsuccessfully to say.
Make America Great Again?
Nah.
This guy and his flag walking the halls of the capital in support of that phrase is why when we see your hats, and hear your catchphrase...
People that look like me get physically nauseous.
I love my country.
I love her dearly.

When training legs, try ending your workout with a focused, high rep compound movement - squats, leg press or in my case today a vertical leg press.
Remember to keep the weight light and focus on the strict movement.
My strength & conditioning coach @daverienzi and I have found it to be extremely beneficial towards your gains.
Welcome back to your gyms, give this finisher a shot and enjoy the burn 😉💪🏾

#Repost from @antiracismdaily
On Sunday, August 23, a Black man was shot in the back seven times by police officers in Kenosha, WI. Reports indicate that the police were on the scene to respond to a domestic dispute, and the victim was attempting to help settle it (Kenosha News). A video of the shooting was widely circulated on social media. In the video, the victim can be seen walking to his car and opening the door before being restrained by a police officer and shot point-blank in the back. A reporter for WISN, a news channel in Wisconsin, later confirmed that the victim is 29-year-old Jacob Blake (Twitter). A large group of people was present to witness the shooting, in addition to his fiancée and children. As of the time of writing this, Blake is in serious condition.⁣⁣

Gigi Hadid,Model,3130.0,1191.0,"Repost @vmagazine : Gigi Journal Part II is here! Presenting a medley of innovative art and fresh perspectives, by artists derived from over 20,000 submissions, the journal serves as a reflection of the events we are all experiencing through its theme: Quaranti(m)e: Your Experience in Quarantine / Honoring Essential Workers. Initially conceived to document creatiVity in quarantine, the journal expanded once the revival of the #BlackLivesMatter movement reignited. As @gigihadid explains as part of her Editor’s Letter, “With only about a week left til this journal’s deadline, at the height of [BLM] protests in the US and around the globe, I felt strongly that it was [our] responsibility to amplify Black-American voices using this platform and privilege.” Available now for pre-order, the journal features Gigi’s hand-painted cover art and 32 exclusive pieces from artists around the globe, as well as written contributions from leaders in the racial-justice movement. Truly a one-of-a-kind hardbound keepsake, the journal’s covers have been printed with solar activated and glow-in-the-dark ink!⁣
⁣
The journal also strives to give back: a percentage of the proceeds will be split among four organizations: @blklivesmatter, @naacp, @aclu_nationwide, and @campaignzero (Gigi has also pledged to match that amount with a personal donation). ⁣

We are not on this earth alone and if you can have a positive, meaningful impact on even one life, then you will become part of the solution and not the problem. I’ve had the privilege of helping @unicef do just that as their Goodwill Ambassador. As I look back on my 20 year journey, I can truly say that this has been one of the greatest honors of my life.

On Giving Tuesday, it’s a reminder that in these trying times, when the world needs us to step up, giving back is no longer an option…it should be a way of life.

A lil’ flashback to the iconic honky tonk I used to hang out in when I was 15 years old.
The one and only @tootsies_orchid_lounge 🎶🥃

I grew up loving traditional country, blues and hip hop - but when I was 15 living in a lil’ motel room in Nashville - just me and a buddy of mine - I thought I could be a decent country music singer to make a little money not be broke 💵 🎤

A woman heard me singing in a grocery store (true story) and told me I should go down to Broad street and try and sing in one of the honky tonks to get noticed.

So that’s what I did.

Keep in mind I was 15, but I actually looked 57 😂🤦🏽‍♂️

One night at a one of country bars, I bought a car from a crackhead for $40 bucks (original agreement was $75:) - and that beat up Thunderbird turned out to be stolen, of course - and about a month later we were forced out of Nashville.

Wound up moving to the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Bethlehem) where I would FINALLY, get my wayward ass on the right track to become a productive young man.

And though my 15yr old dream of become a country music legend, never came true... years later, my buddy - the GOAT Willie Nelson would gift me my very first guitar.

Which I learned to play pretty well. Didn’t matter anyway because I proudly sing in raspy keys that don’t exist
🎼🤣🙋🏽‍♂️💁🏽‍♂️

Miley Cyrus,Musician,814.0,749.0,"Mary Jane 5EVR

I wrote this song in Malibu years ago on a piano in a house that no longer exists. About my dog Mary Jane who is also gone now.

A lot has changed over time. Mostly me.

Music is my medicine. This song revolves around loss & heartache. Which I am currently experiencing after Mary Jane’s passing.

MJ was a true queen. She wore her grace, dignity & kindness like a crown. She will never be forgotten and will forever be missed. To know her is to love her. It has been my honor being her mom and best friend.

Vin Diesel,Actor,1653.0,64.0,"So after completing the long but rewarding sessions for ADR on Bloodshot, I was able to really see a large part of the movie. I remember heading to Africa over a year ago to embark on filming. The objective was ambitious but clear... to launch Vailiant Comics in the cinematic space, while... and more importantly taking a new approach to the superhero genre. Wow. Just wow. I see why I needed so much time to return from that character. For one thing, Haha... to say he is Crazy is an understatement. It is also clear why Bloodshot has been the Military’s favorite comic. The themes of the forgotten or exploited soldier run deep. At the core is love... however it’s use is altogether new and completely engaging... sorry to go on, but the nuances have stayed with me and as always you make me feel comfortable to share those deeper thoughts. Again, thank you for believing in me. Only hope to make you proud.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Well here’s the destruction 🤦🏽‍♂️ I left behind after pulling my gates off myself and going to work.
This footage was taken from my security after I had already left and he arrived on the scene.
The second video is of our technicians and welders carrying one of the gates and placing it gently in the grass.
As you guys know from my last post, there was a power outage at my house, causing my gates to not open.
Sure as hell wasn’t my best hour, but there were a lot of people waiting for me at work so I did what I had to do, hopped in my pick up and went to work.
Maybe next time I’ll just hop the gates and call an Uber.
Actually, no I won’t.
There’s no fun in that 😈
Jokes aside, THANK YOU to the techs and welders who mobilized very quickly in the morning to come over and take care of the destruction.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Just one of those days where I wasn’t in the mood.
We’ve all been there.

Priyanka Chopra,Actor,3252.0,556.0,"One of the several challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic globally has been its impact on the education system. With classrooms going online for the immediate future, there is still uncertainty over what school will look like in the months to come. This uncertainty takes on another meaning for many girls around the world… the question isn’t when they will return to school—it’s if they will return at all. Due to ripple effects from COVID-19, experts predict that tens of millions more adolescent girls could remain out of school forever. We cannot let this happen.  

I urge you to read the new op-ed by @MichelleObama and @MelindaFrenchGates (link in my bio) about how we can all support them and then take immediate action with the @GirlsOpportunityAlliance at gofundme.com/girlsopportunityalliance. Together, we can ensure that girls continue to pursue their education and dream their dreams… because when girls get the education they deserve, our whole world benefits.",1148.0,250005.0,2020-08-07 16:17:02+00:00,Photo,2020.0,8.0,7.0,16.0,Friday,2020-08-07,55854945.0,163.0,

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"“So shines a good deed, in a weary world” 👏🏾🙏🏾💫

This morning I introduced our babies to one of my all time fav films - Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.
They loved it and now fully expect me to deliver a room full of chocolate and candy.
That’ll be my next project 🤣
Some cool history - back in the early 2000’s, iconic director, Tim Burton had considered me to play Willy Wonka is his remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
I remember thinking “HOLY SHIT, IM IN” 🎶 😳🙋🏽‍♂️
But that was many years ago when I was just starting out in Hollywood with no foundation of global box office strength or any real acting experience to even pull it off.
The role, of course went to Johnny Depp, who at that time was the biggest star in the world.
The rest was history.
And down the road I went.
The fact that Tim even considered me (albeit I’m sure he considered for all of 7 seconds:) sure meant a helluva lot to me as I was just breaking in to the business with no idea what the future had in store.
I’ll always raise a glass 🥃 to the dreams that don’t come true, because sometimes they’re the best thing that never happened.

Creating while channeling our beloved Karl for this project was an honor and joy, and I had so much fun seeing everyone’s take on the shirt last week. He would have loved being remembered this way.
For those of you who have asked or are interested, the concept of my shirt is inspired by polaroids I took of Karl. The back is a painted and stitched version of an image I shot of him in Paris, and on the front I attached a Polaroid of Karl’s suit and accessories that I shot in Milan, both in 2017. I always loved the details in Karl’s outfits and studied them whenever I could. He sometimes wore suits with staples on the collar and shoulders, so I added staples to the collar and to fasten the short sleeves of the shirt. I will be forever grateful for the times he let me shoot him. He was supportive of my creative side which gave me so much confidence. It felt natural to incorporate that into the shirt.

Willing to sacrifice during these unprecedented & unpredictable times.
I have so much respect for all the @ufc fighters and my fellow @wwe pro wrestlers who are willing to “put on the show” during these COVID times for the ones that matter most - the fans.

Donald Trump has shown that he is not the right person to lead the United States. Kindness and empathy must win this time - and it’s up to people of all ages to do their part: register to vote, wear a mask to the polling station or get a mail-in ballot, and be an example of that kindness and empathy that we want to see in office.

Dwayne Johnson,Actor,5426.0,389.0,"Merry Christmas, Bruno 🎅🏾 Love you, brother! 100% crackhead free 👹😊

My life (especially my teenage years) has been full of the wildest twists and turns - yet God and the universe had always found a way to put a few people in my path that would change the trajectory of the road I was going down.

Meet one of my lifelong friends, Bruno Lauer — or I prefer to call him, “Downtown Bruno” 😉 🤟🏾

My mom and I were evicted off the island of Hawaii and I was sent to Nashville, Tennessee to live with my dad.

When I landed in Nashville, I quickly found out I wasn’t gonna live with my dad.

Shit happens, plans change and that’s the way it goes.

Instead, I told I was gonna live with a guy named Bruno. Who at the time lived in a tiny room at a spot called the Alamo Plaza motel.

Bruno could’ve (and should’ve) said hell no, I’m not takin’ in some kid who I don’t know.

But he didn’t.

He took this punk kid in and we became lifelong friends.

Then ironically - about 9 years later when I had the infamous “$7 Bucks” in my pocket - I started my wrestling career in Memphis, Tennessee and AGAIN - had no place to live and Bruno took me and let me shake up in his trailer, til I could get on my feet.

And hell, when I was 15yrs old, Bruno even gave me his last $40 bucks so I could hustle a crackhead out of his car one night at a honky tonk in Nashville 😈🤦🏾‍♂️

But the hustle was on me, because when I took off down the road there was a SECOND CRACKHEAD passed out on the floor in the back! 👹

Wild times at 15yrs old.

Merry Christmas, Bruno and since you helped me “buy” my first car - I figured I could return the favor and buy you one that 100% does NOT have a crackhead in the back seat.

I love you, brother.

Your kindness and heart - helped change my life’s trajectory.

And when you’re ready to retire from “the business” you just say the word.

I got you covered.

We’ll go “downtown” 🤟🏾

Enjoy your new ride and give Walls, Mississippi my love and gratitude 🖤

・・・
I want to share with you some joyful news. On Monday, I became a father. This is Wyatt Cooper. He is three days old. He is named after my father, who died when I was ten. I hope I can be as good a dad as he was. My son's middle name is Morgan. It's a family name on my mom's side. I know my mom and dad liked the name morgan because I recently found a list they made 52 years ago when they were trying to think of names for me. Wyatt Morgan Cooper. My son. He was 7.2 lbs at birth, and he is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy.

As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I’m grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son's birth.
Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him. It is an extraordinary blessing - what she, and all surrogates give to families who cant have children. My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives

I do wish my mom and dad and my brother, Carter, were alive to meet Wyatt, but I like to believe they can see him. I imagine them all together, arms around each other, smiling and laughing, happy to know that their love is alive in me and in Wyatt, and that our family continues.",30757.0,1496896.0,2020-05-01 04:44:31+00:00,Photo,2020.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,Friday,2020-05-01,88579630.0,318.0,

It’s Breonna Taylor’s birthday this Friday. Her favorite colors were blue and purple @iamkevingates was one of her favorite artists. She was an EMT on the frontlines during corona. Around midnight on March 13th police broke down her door and shot her 8 times, no evidence of a crime was uncovered. The sole crime was the murder of Breonna Taylor. Her crime being asleep in her own home. @battymamzelle thought of a great way to honor Breonna’s birthday, send cards to the attorney general. The most underserved demographic in America is black women, we cannot allow them to forget Breonna. #birthdayforbreonna #justiceforbreonnataylor.

Boxing is more than a sport. I don’t know who I would be if I hadn’t wandered into a gym as a miserable teenager. I have been able to see the world, have a positive impact on my community, gained friends and family...but there are many who don’t want trans athletes to be a part of the athletic world.

Despite all the misinformation, trans athletes want the same as every athlete: a chance to participate and grow with the sport they love. We can’t fight this battle alone and fortunately we don’t have to.

@AthleteAlly works to dismantle the structures of oppression that isolate, exclude and endanger LGBTQI+ people in sport, especially trans and nonbinary youth. In the past year, 19 states in the US have introduced horrific legislation targeting trans youth and their ability to play sports simply because of who they are.  

Because of COVID-19, LGBTQI+ youth are at increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Sports are proven to reduce depression for LGBTQI+ youth. All athletes, and especially trans youth, deserve life-saving access to sports. Join Athlete Ally and help us fight to make sports welcoming for all.

One of my favorite walks is thru our @teremana distillery’s barrel room.

This is the final quality process of our first aged expression — Teremana Reposado 🥃

We age our tequila in American white oak barrels and it reacts to the temperatures here in the Jalisco Highlands of Mexico.

The wood expands and contracts and after a certain period of time - gives our tequila a very rich and smooth taste with notes of oak and vanilla.

Those notes and smoothness are why Teremana has become very distinctly delicious to our consumers.

I founded Teremana as a legacy brand that’s rooted in quality, passion, trust and mana.

And on behalf of our entire Teremana team and myself — it’s our privilege to produce Teremana tequila for you.

And most importantly, thank you for making our Teremana your #1 choice in tequila.

The tequila of the people 🥃

On a personal note, it’s a very proud milestone moment for me, because it’s my first as an actor & co-producer AND this is the first Hindi production for @purplepebblepictures. I hope it gives you all the feels, and inspires you to celebrate life!

Thank YOU to every creative collaborator involved on this project! If one person was missing I would not be writing this message. @billboard

To my fucking idols @joanjett @billyidol and @stevienicks your blessing, guidance, inspiration , and validation mean everything to me. Even though you 3 would tell me I do not need validation from anyone but my fucking self. The confidence I have in who I am / what I am doing stems from the values instilled by looking up to you as my role models from the beginning.

JJ, I have you to thank for my love of leather, playing music at an unholy level of loud, and my uncompromising sense of self. I fucking love you.

Stevie,
Your words have been coming out of my mouth since I can remember .... but mine flowing from yours is still surreal. Your generosity is unrivaled. Thank you for lending your magic! I am forever your “smiley baby”.... I love you

BILLY FUCKING IDOL!
We’ve been “rebel yelling” since 2012 when I brought a photo of you to the salon and said “I wanna look like that”. You are brazen, bold, unapologetic, and authentic in a way that is my honor to witness . I appreciate you deeply.

TO MY NEWEST FRIEND, @DUALIPA -
Thank you for allowing me to cover you in cherry juice, lick your face and for playing at a dirty rock club w me! You’re fearlessness is all that could outshine you’re fabulousness. I love you forever.

He values hard work and is loyal to the core. Never one to follow trends, he’s become a trailblazer, pioneer, educator and an inspiration to artists around the world. I’m so excited I can finally announce our 2nd collaboration together. I’ve watched him work passionately for the past year on this collection and campaign (and he’s also driven us all crazy!) in his quest for perfection.

This is because of the Ethiopian government’s investment in education and its dedication to the future of the country...but there is still so much work to do. 2.6 M children of primary and secondary school age are out of school, and 50% of children attending school drop out by grade 8. Because of poverty children are responsible for much more than just learning, like caring for siblings, walking miles to collect water and other house hold chores...things that should not be a child’s responsibility at any age. A child is a child. @unicef’s efforts, along with a very committed government, are focused on getting every child in school, ensuring every child has a quality education, and that every child completes school.

A sad Christmas song I wrote a few years back right before the holidays. Was feeling like shit cause I couldn’t be with the one I loved.

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"🌻✨✌🏻 So honoured to be working alongside Nobel Peace Laureates @nadia_murad_taha, @drdenismukwege @ouidedbouchamaoui, and other 🧠 thought leaders, 🌈 creatives and 🌱💪🏻 campaigners such as @AranyaJohar Assia Benziane @missaissa as part of the Gender Equality Council advising the G7 this year during the French Presidency. 💐 It's a source of sadness to us all that Nasrin Sotoudeh can only participate in absentia. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻💞 Together we’ll be continuing the work of the first Council convened last year in Canada and will be pushing G7 states and others to do more to make gender equality a reality at home and abroad. ⏰ At a time when many might feel a loss of confidence in politicians and the state, it's easy to forget how vital 🗳 national governments and👩🏼‍⚖️ legislation are in the ⚙️ wheel of factors that create meaningful and lasting change.♟📰 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
❤️🚨 Disengaging is quite simply not an option when in many parts of the world, we're seeing roll-backs 🕰🔙 on women and girls' rights and 🚫💰 cutbacks and corrosions to the basic state services that guarantee these rights. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🙋🏼‍♀️ As a Council, we’ll be recommending ways that states can improve their laws 🔎📜✍🏻 to strengthen women’s rights and will be encouraging them to make new commitments to ensure accountability and access to justice. 🗣⚖️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🏃🏼‍♀️💨 The clock is ticking though and we have a lot of work to do before the G7 meets in the summer, ⏳☀️ but I'm excited to work alongside so many experts I admire, and to learn from my Council colleagues and the civil society groups that come together as W7. ✊🏻💛
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As one of the youngest members of the group, 🍃🌸 I hope to bring the perspective of different generations to the table, as well as ensuring that the voices of the many activists, campaigners, women's organisations and movements that I've spent the past years working with and👂🏻💓 listening to, reverberate through the Council's work. 🎶🌼

David Beckham,Athlete,1287.0,504.0,"Today we say goodbye to a great man...As I look back on what and who made me as a person and as a player, my dad, the Boss and Eric. I was stood one day in The Cliff training ground in the reception just about to go to Annie Kay’s house (my digs) and Neil Webb walks past me and out the door, then Eric walks down the stairs from his office and right up to me and says “You will replace him in the first team one day“ I smiled with excitement but I also thought that’s not gonna happen any time soon and then it did. The Cliff training ground brings back so many memories as does Littleton road of Eric, 2 laps warm up, 5 ball routine, 12 minute run and the damn heading game which as you can imagine I did not like, but it was all about preparing us for the first team and preparing to play for Sir Alex Ferguson & Manchester United. David stop playing those #*!¥*+€ Hollywood balls will forever be the words that stay in my head but then Eric has me kicking a ball against a wall 60 times with both feet from different distances and that became one of my biggest strengths. Ultimately it was The Boss that had that faith in us and took us to the next level but the person that prepared us and we wouldn’t have been the players and men we turned out to be was Eric...

Shakira,Musician,1722.0,107.0,"Tratar de resumir una persona tan grande en pocas palabras como Gabo es una tarea muy difícil pero intentar recordar alguien como él es realmente muy fácil. Todos conocemos, millones de personas conocemos, la magia de sus libros y de sus historias pero pocos hemos tenido la fortuna de conocer la magia de la que estaba hecho él mismo.
Yo en este sentido puedo considerarme una afortunada cuando a los 21 años - creo que tenía 21 años cuando lo conocí en su casa de Bogotá - porqué quería escribir sobre mí. La verdad que no tenía ni idea porqué alguien como Gabo quería escribir sobre mí ya que nunca me creí tan interesante…
En realidad quien quedó cautivada en ese encuentro fui yo y sí, quedé cautivada por su sentido del humor, por su calidez, por su humanidad y por su forma de hablar adornada de tantos aires costumbristas que solo a él le pertenecían.
Realmente conversar con Gabo era cómo entrar en otra dimensión ajena al resto de los mortales. Era ver a un hombre entrado en años explorar el mundo de los otros como si fuese un niño, con una curiosidad inagotable, con una sed de saber y de inventar también… Me acuerdo cuando me decía “Shakira, si no me lo cuentas, me lo invento”… Así que para mí fue un honor cuando me pidió escribir para la película que trataba de abarcar “El Amor En Los Tiempos Del Cólera” y sí, escribí dos de mis mejores canciones hasta la fecha que fueron “Hay Amores” y “Despedida”… Como podía negarme a semejante honor y lujo de poder participar en un proyecto en el que estuviera involucrado Gabriel García Márquez?
Él lo dijo una vez: “Recordar es fácil para aquellos que tienen buena memoria y olvidar es difícil para los que tienen corazón”. Que sepas Gabo que mantenemos en nuestros corazones todo lo que dejaste en ellos y te seguimos recordando para mantenerte vivo.

To kick it off, I would like to raise a toast to the incredible, hardworking men and women of our Teremana Team in Jalisco, Mexico 🇲🇽, our distillery workers and Jimadors.
From our agave fields to our brick ovens to our handmade copper pots to our beautiful bottles, they make our Teremana Tequila with the utmost pride, precision, care and mana.
Each and every one of them (myself included) are so humbled and happy at how much you guys have loved our Teremana Tequila, and we have loved every second of creating it for you.

Here’s to them, to you, and to the craft of making the tequila of the people.
Happy National Tequila Weekend!

Salud’, my friends and enjoy your mana 🥃🤙🏾

Jay was selling his comic book memorabilia just so he can buy his kids toys for Christmas 🎄🧸

These great kids lost their mama (Jay’s wife) as she passed away, three years ago during Christmas time.

So our goal was to help create the best Christmas ever for his kids as well as for kids in need all around the world.

We also wanted to take care of Jay too because he’s a good man and the world needs more like him.

Thank you to Dwanta’s good buddy @johnkrasinski and the great folks @somegoodnews for helping create this awesome moment.

And a huge Dwanta 🎅🏾🙏🏾 THANK YOU to our great friends at @fedex for this enormous donation of $5 MILLION DOLLARS!!! to @marinetoysfortotsfoundation.

Merry Christmas Jay to you and your kids. Stay strong and mahalo for being such an inspiration!

Emma Watson,Actor,222.0,51.0,"From Greta ❤️: “I am brimming with happiness—thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you (that’s six!) to the Academy. This film of Little Women has been over thirty years in the making, from the very first time Louisa May Alcott and Jo March reached across time and space and made me believe I could be a writer and creator. Every single person who worked on this film poured their heart and soul into it, and we are all so grateful to the Academy for recognizing the collective effort. I am so personally proud of each person who worked on the film, and I am bursting with joy for all of them. I have to say a few names loudly, because I am just so deeply thrilled for them—my filming partner/wizard/genius Saoirse Ronan, you are my inspiration and my honesty and my co-captain, always, my baby girl superstar Florence Pugh, the Marmee of our dreams Laura Dern (woot! Marriage Story!!), our gorgeously talented and ridiculously intelligent Emma Watson, the bright shining soul and life force Eliza Scanlen, our Queen Meryl, and the fifth March sister and all around prince Timothee Chalamet. The men who, as Louisa says, make “chivalry worth having,” Chris Cooper, Tracy Letts, James Norton, Bob Odenkirk, and Louis Garrel The costumes of Jacqueline Durran, the sets of Jess Gonchor, and the music of Alexandre Desplat—they gave me such incredible gifts and each frame of the movie is filled with their skill and work and care. Amy Pascal, I have no words big enough but you know what is in my heart. Everyone at Sony and Columbia Pictures, especially to Tom Rothman, my favorite sparring partner and tireless champion. Writing and directing this film was an honor and sharing it with audiences has been the most sincerely heart-warming journey. I hope our Little Women does for another generation of girls and women what it did for me: lights a fire to write your book, make your movie, sing your verse. From all of us Little Women and Men, thank you to the Academy.”",4031.0,2235860.0,2020-01-14 23:47:10+00:00,Photo,2020.0,1.0,14.0,23.0,Tuesday,2020-01-14,55864658.0,356.0,

20 years ago my buddy Bill Gates and I debuted the very first ever @Xbox console to the world.
Now two decades later, I’m partnering up with @Microsoft once again to launch their brand new XBOX Series X to the world.

BUT the best part about this partnership is I have the absolute privilege to deliver ONE OF A KIND “ROCK XBOX Series X” consoles to 20 different children’s hospitals that will eventually reach over 50,000 KIDS!!!! 🎉🥳🚨

These kids are battling through their illnesses with incredible bravery and I’m thrilled @microsoft, @gamersoutreach and myself can provide some joy and smiles.

You kids show me and the world, what real strength means.

・・・
Back in 2013, nine-year-old Shafali Verma accompanied her dad to witness Sachin Tendulkar’s final Ranji Trophy match. Here, she sat atop her father’s shoulders at the Bansi Lal stadium in Haryana, screeching at the top of her voice, “Sachin, Sachin!” as she cheered on the legendary cricket hero. And as fate would have it, the girl who once stanned Tendulkar has just gone on to smash his 30-year-old international cricket record. This also isn't the first international record this teenage wonder from the city of Rohtak has broken. Head to the link in bio for all the deets, including Verma's origin story which involved her disguising herself as a boy to train at cricket academies that wouldn't allow girls admission. @shafalisverma17 #SachinTendulkar #Cricket #T20",2019.0,699626.0,2019-11-12 12:33:19+00:00,Photo,2019.0,11.0,12.0,12.0,Tuesday,2019-11-12,37827324.0,161.0,
